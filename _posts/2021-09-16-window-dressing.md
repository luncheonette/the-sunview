> When one undergoes the interrogation of shop windows, one also pronounces one's
> own sentence. In fact, one's choice is "round trip." From the demand of shop
> windows, from the inevitable response to shop windows, the fixation of choice
> is determined. No obstinacy, ad absurdum, of hiding _the coition through a glass
> pane with one or many objects of the shop windows_. The penalty consists in
> cutting the pane and in gnawing at your thumbs as soon as possession is
> consummated.

_Window Dressing_ is a video and sound installation by [Amy Ruhl](https://www.amyruhlfilm.com/) that is
accessible at the front exterior window of the Sunview Luncheonette. The work
invites visitors to be intimate with the inanimate surfaces at the periphery of
the diner, as the window itself carries the sound of the images viewed through
a small, low peephole. Drawing from the fantastic worlds of commodity display
and fairy tales, Ruhl juxtaposes highly stylized imagery of phantasmagoric and
seductive objects with their literal consumption. An extension of her ongoing
interdisciplinary project _[Between Tin Men](https://betweentinmen.com/)_, _Window Dressing_ plays with themes of
fetishism, commodity display, voyeurism and desire. The installation activates
the facade of the luncheonette after its long hiatus, while using the interior
as a host body for dreamlike projections to entice and repel.
