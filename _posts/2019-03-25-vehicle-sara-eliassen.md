Vehicle is a monthly meeting where a group of artists and other interested
practitioners get together, drink, munch, and have candid conversations about
the work they produce.

This meeting will take place on Monday March 25 at 7pm.

The Sunview Luncheonette<br>
221 Nassau Street, Brooklyn NY 11222

Sara Eliassen will present material from a larger project-in-progress,
exploring the role contemporary digital screen culture plays in the re-rise
of desires around nationalist visions, and how the screen; both technology
and image material, take part in the production of our memory and the
presetting of our future actions.

Sara Eliassen is an artist/filmmaker and currently a Phd candidate in
artistic research at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts.
