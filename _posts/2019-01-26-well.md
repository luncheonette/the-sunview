"Recently, I’ve been using watercolor to paint images related to the oil
industry in Texas' Permian Basin. My family is from Texas, and it is a
landscape that I love. However, my anxiety about the environmental toll of
fracking and the industry's shortsightedness have led to complicated emotions
and fractured perception, which I seek to embody in my work. Car windows often
serve as frames or lenses for the landscape. In my studio, I lay large sheets
of watercolor paper down on the floor and paint from above. Rather than depict
the horizontality of the place, I layer and stack images, attempting to show a
sense of time going down deep like roots. Landscape is 'a way of seeing'
determined by historical and cultural forces; not solely geographic, they are
biographical and personal too. Another way to put it would be that there are no
landscapes, only contexts." – KB Jones

"In the early 2010's I made a trio of videos of young women reciting texts that
address language and popular culture. The subject matter of each narrative was
personally relevant to me as a suburban adolescent who was deeply invested in
counter culture. One of these works, Go Ask Alice, shows a pet snake eating and
regurgitating an egg while the made-for-television movie of the cautionary
diaristic teen novel, also called Go Ask Alice, is heard, and ultimately seen,
in the background. There are inherent and constructed contradictions in this
pairing to create an intense, extended moment where the visceral phenomenon of
the snake's actions and the staged reality of the television program
intersect." – Juliana Paciulli

"The show title is 'Well', and the meanings that come to mind first (but appear
last in the dictionary (merriam-webster.com)) are 'free or recovered from
infirmity or disease: healthy' or 'being in satisfactory condition or
circumstances'.  Those first impressions are probably due to a preoccupation
with 'well-being'; the subject of my work (mugs) falls in the same line.  Mugs
are an embodiment of contentment within our grasp.

In my paintings I crop close around the handles, enlarging them to nearly three
feet, and the rounded forms, so familiar and basic, become harder to know.
Design and decoration mingle with murky reflections and ambient light - context
muddies the surfaces.  Maybe the way to stay well is to explore rather than
avoid inevitable disruptions, to seek potential in the riddled present, to
become more familiar with ambivalence and disgust.  I see Juliana and K.B.'s
work as a step ahead in this regard." – Julia Goldman

KB, Juliana and Julia all live and work in New York City.
