Come out this Friday for KITCHEN SYNC: Homesick reverberations from the cutting board**♪ A night of live sound performances, video art, and poetry. 

————————————————————— 

Presented by: “Huiyi Chen & Wenjing Liu generate soundscapes from the everyday ritual of cooking, transforming the kitchen into a site of healing and resistance. 

Narelle Zhao employs video and writing to illuminate the dynamics of family, memory, and cultural heritage through site-specific performances. 

Annabelle Yep’s irreverent prose-poetry dissects disparate landscapes to explore desire, home, and the body in flux.”
