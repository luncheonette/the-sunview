### Core of the Coalman (Jorge Boehringer – UK)

Jorge Boehringer is an composer, artist, and researcher exploring layered
processes from the microscape to the landscape, and how they interact with
perceptual experience. Utilizing a protean platform for experimentation and
presentation, Boehringer creates performances, recordings, music,
installations, texts, three-dimensional objects, and visual phenomena.
Boehringer’s work offers an experience of reality presented as a textural field.
Multiple systems of events, appearing and disappearing, and evolving at their
own rates... [https://coreofthecoalman.bandcamp.com/](https://coreofthecoalman.bandcamp.com/)
