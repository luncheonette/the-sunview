<p>Free. Refreshments provided.</p>
<p>We will be joined by tenants rights attorneys and local housing advocates and will cover such topics as: what to do if you receive an eviction notice, how to tell if you are (or should be) rent stabilized, how to form a tenants association, and current issues within the North Brooklyn community. Bring your questions, and hope to see you there!</p>
<p>Listen to a podcast from the event as Tim Collins, a tenants rights lawyer who has worked closely with the Rent Guidelines Board in New York City, explains why we have such "crappy housing policies" in New York, and why corruption in Albany is to blame.</p>
