<p><a href="http://596acres.org/news/2014/03/01/vacant-acres-symposium-advocates-from-all-over-the-world/">Vacant Acres Symposium</a>Â participants and friends are invited to join us for a delicious cozy meal at The Sunview Luncheonette in Greenpoint, Brooklyn following the first day of conference events. Please reserve your plate now as the space and the chef are limited and we'd love to know who's coming! We'll make sure that a group excursion from the New School is coordinated.</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 22 at 7pm, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.</p>
<p>More about Uncle Ruth: <a href="http://www.uncleruth.com">http://www.uncleruth.com</a></p>
<p>We're hoping for a wine sponsor but may ask you to bring a bottle. We'll be in touch with all you eaters!</p>
<p>Dinner is $20 per person and is nearly full up. We're looking for a volunteer to help staff the open kitchen and learn Uncle Ruth's secrets and eat for free, 6:30-11pm. Email paula@596acres.org if that's you.</p>
<p>We'll be releasing the remaining dinner tickets the week before the event. Drop a line to paula@596acres.org if you'd like to the first to know when you can get them.</p>
