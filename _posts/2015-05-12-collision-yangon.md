<p>Photographer <strong><a href="http://andrewrowat.com">Andrew Rowat</a></strong> will present <em>Collision Yangon</em> – his project on the forces coming together in the crucible that is Yangon, Myanmar.</p>
<p>“Opposing forces of so-called modernity and development pressing up against traditional ways of life; new buildings displacing old; religious tension between Buddhists and others (mainly Muslims); political uncertainty as dictatorship transitions to a form of hybrid democracy; and the energy of the place — roiling currents of optimism and unbridled hope for a future yet unwritten.”</p>
<p>A slide presentation followed by Q+A. Burmese appetizers. BYOB.</p>
