There is going to be a screening of [TIGHTEN YOUR BELTS, BITE THE
BULLET](http://icarusfilms.com/if-tyb) (1980), a film by James Gaffney, Martin
Lucas, & Jonathan Miller that examines the causes of and the divergent
responses to the 1970s fiscal crises in New York City and Cleveland!

We're cooking some squash soup & biscuits to eat before the screening! And
after, discussing the role local governments --and people!-- might play in the
context of federal cuts underway! In a chill way! Bring friends!
