Please come to the luncheonette on Saturday, March 11 at 7:00PM for
ARTIST-HORROR I: Bluebeard, first in a new horror series about monstrous
artists. The opener is Edgar G. Ulmer's _Bluebeard_ from 1944, in which John
Carradine plays Gaston Morel, a portraitist who murders anyone that he paints.
Greedy art dealers, puppet shows, artist as romantic/vampiric enervating force,
free pizza and beer. Hangouts at 7, film at 8.
