The evening will commence at around 7pm with poetry by [Mel
Elberg](https://www.poetryproject.org/publications/the-recluse/issue-10/five-poems-mel-elberg)
and Nicole Wallace and continue with music/noise performances by
[kite](http://kitekitekitekite.com/), Laura Ortman, [Inef
Coupe](https://soundcloud.com/inefcoupe), Natty Gray, and a dj set by
bitchha√ºs.

In the interest of being anti-superspreader, we will require proof of
vaccinations and masks, with a reception in McGolrick Park.

There will be paintings at the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">Sunview
Luncheonette</a> by Belle Rose, and after dark, a <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/window-dressing/">peephole</a>.
