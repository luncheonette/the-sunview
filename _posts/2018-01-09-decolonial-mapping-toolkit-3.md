Sunview Luncheonette hosts Frontview/The Decolonial Mapping Toolkit. 

We are pleased to invite you to the second stage of the toolkit process: a series of semi-public workshops produced by Frontview in collaboration with visual activist and writer Nicholas Mirzoeff. 

These workshops, as decolonial events, tackle large-scale systemic issues affected by colonialism and as such includes a key array of participants for politically productive discussions on the colonial process and how to dismantle it.  

These workshops seek to build meaningful and intimate connections between various groups. 

Frontview and Nicholas Mirzoeff are excited to join forces with Decolonize This Place, who will be hosting the first workshop on January 14th at the Pratt Center for Community Development from 2:30–5 pm. We hope to see you there and please do not hesitate to reach out beforehand with any questions. The following workshops will build on this first one, and we would highly appreciate your attendance to subsequent workshops on January 21st at Bluestockings in the Lower East Side, and January 28 at the lovely Sunview Luncheonette in Greenpoint. Please RSVP by filling out the forms linked below.

Frontview is a team of facilitators, curators, and writers operating to create artistic political encounters on meaningful scales, creating new relationships and intensifying existing ones. Our conceptual base is Buckminster Fuller’s Dymaxion map: a map that has no “correct” positioning, in which there is neither an up nor a down nor cardinal points of any kind. Frontview is a house representing a new form of art institution. Within the canopy of our home, we dedicate ourselves to hosting artists, thinkers, architects, activists, scientists, engineers and more to have a domain where they can foster their work collectively in and out of artistic concerns and practices. We integrate all mediums in a space that gives them the liberty to speak freely. Together we aim to actively create our futures rather than idly let the future happen to us. The collectives core team of curators are Mohammad Golabi, Patrick Jaojoco, and Lalita Salander.
