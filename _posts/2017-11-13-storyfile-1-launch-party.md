Please join me next Saturday the 12th to celebrate the launch of [Storyfile](http://www.storyfile.online/), a new art & literary journal which debuted at NYABF.\
Contributors to the first two issues will be reading, including myself, alongside dinner and tunes.

**Dinner & Reading & Party**

We will also soft-launch [Dogshoppe](http://www.dogshoppe.biz/product/storyfile), an online book, zine, and object place.\
Storyfile operates in the interest of experimentation and collaboration, as an outlet for writers and artists to participate and expand their work on the printed page, and as a platform for conversation regarding storytelling and design. The collective spirit of mid-20th-century independent and underground presses is the basis for how we work together and what we produce.

Hope to see you there!\
