IVO BOL (live sampling - synthesis)<br>
Ivo Bol is a composer / performer from Amsterdam. "Composing involves listening
to the world around you. To the hum of the fridge or the noise of the record
just before the song starts. When performing I use my body to manipulate these
sounds with light sensors, touch, gesture or brainwaves."
