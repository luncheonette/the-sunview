#### CHARLÉNE DARLING

plays in French free-rock bands (Rose Mercie, La Ligne Claire) ranging from
emotional lo-fi songs to no wave anthems. When playing alone her songs get even
more minimal than usual and speak of love in every obsessional form.

Influences: Ann Briggs, Shirley Collins, Harry Nilsson, Robert Wyatt, Brigitte
Fontaine, Alain Bashung, Wendy René, Gary Panter, Regis Turner
