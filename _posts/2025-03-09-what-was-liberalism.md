What Was Liberalism? is an illustrated talk by Robby Herbst reflecting on
liberalism and the participatory Model Cities program developed by Lyndon
Johnson (President '63 -'69). Using a lens of participatory art, we can look at
the models fostered by Model Cites, and speculate what America might look like
if it invested in genuinely democratic power. 

Robby Herbst is an artist, writer, and organizer with a history of critically
interpreting social and political movements. He's a recent transplant from Los
Angeles to New York. He is a co-founder of the Llano Del Rio Collective and the
Journal of Aesthetics and Protest.
