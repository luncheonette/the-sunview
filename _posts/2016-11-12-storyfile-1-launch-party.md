<p>Please join me next Saturday the 12th to celebrate the launch of <a href="http://www.storyfile.online/">Storyfile</a>, a new art &amp; literary journal which debuted at NYABF.<br />
Contributors to the first two issues will be reading, including myself, alongside dinner and tunes.</p>
<p><b>S t o r y f i l e </b></p>
<p><b>Dinner &amp; Reading &amp; Party</b><br />
We will also soft-launch <a href="http://www.dogshoppe.biz/product/storyfile">Dogshoppe</a>, an online book, zine, and object place.<br />
Storyfile operates in the interest of experimentation and collaboration, as an outlet for writers and artists to participate and expand their work on the printed page, and as a platform for conversation regarding storytelling and design. The collective spirit of mid-20th-century independent and underground presses is the basis for how we work together and what we produce.<br />
Hope to see you there!<br />
