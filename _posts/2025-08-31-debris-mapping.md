Debris Mapping with [Tricia Enns](https://triciaenns.com/) and [Trash
Club](https://trashclub.nyc/)

We will start at 6:30 with a short talk about what "debris" is, about what it
means to steward urban space, and how to see and feel differently on the
streets. We will then go on a meditative walk to find debris, and return to
sunview to make our own Debris Maps, embedded in handmade recycled paper.
