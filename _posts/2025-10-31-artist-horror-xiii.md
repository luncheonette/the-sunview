**ARTIST-HORROR XIII: Hallowe'en Extravaganza**<br>
Three short segments from Amicus horror anthology films<br>
Friday, October 31, 7:00 pm

**From _The House That Dripped Blood_ (1971): "Waxworks"**
Something uncanny keeps drawing two men back to view a sculpture of Salome at a
wax museum, where they eventually learn from where the sculptor sources his John
the Baptist heads. Animate/inanimate in the locus classicus of artist-horror.
Peter Cushing!

**From _The Vault of Horror_ (1973): "Drawn & Quartered"**
The artist Moore discovers that anything he paints can be destroyed by
destroying the painted image itself. Reality/representation, artwork-horror, and
corrupt artworld shenanigans. Tom Baker of Dr. Who fame!

**From _Dr. Terror's House of Horrors_ (1965): "Disembodied Hand"**
Painter Eric Lindor exacts revenge upon the pompous art writer Franklyn Marsh
from beyond the grave. Artist vs. critic on the problem of abstraction and the
problem of violent retribution. Micah Gaugh vs. Christopher Lee!
