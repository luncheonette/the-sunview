The Baltimore duo Rosemary Krust has been a musical love of mine for nearly
ten years. I'm very excited to present them to Brooklyn at the cosy Sunview
Luncheonette, and to cook a big batch of soup for the occasion. Please come
to our party on Fri Feb 22, and also enjoy tunes by fellow bedroom lofi
Baltimorean Yes, Selma, as well as my own duo set with Bob Bannister.

I really hope you can make it!<br>
-Rose Thomas Bannister

"Baltimore natives Katherine Plummer and William Hardy formed Rosemary Krust
in 2007. They practice a kind of 'cucina povera' aesthetic of regional
experimentalism. Minimalist rock and folk forms the basis for much of their
sound, but are often completely eschewed in performative emotionally
cathartic maelstroms of improvisation. Releases and performances of the duo
have been scarce, but cassettes and singles can be found on the Spleencoffin,
MT6, Goaty, Dull Knife and Washy Labels." -Spleencoffin

Yes, Selma is the bedroom recording project of Chad Beattie. Check the
internet for the video for "I Don't Want to See You (Alone Anymore)." "A
world lit by a single bulb in an empty room." -Simon Lewis

"A nimble guitarist, a grippling storyteller, clever lyricist and strong,
dynamic singer with a direct, clear, matter-of-fact voice," Nebraska native
Rose Thomas Bannister weaves her Great-Plains-gothic songs in Brooklyn now,
where she has also curated several folk and experimental concert series.
