<p><strong>About:</strong></p>
<p>Lisa Schonberg is a drummer, writer and artist with a background in entomology. Seven years ago she co-authored petitions to the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service to list several native species of Hawaiian bees as endangered. Last year Lisa spent a month visiting sites in Hawaii documenting these rare bees and their habitats. Lisa brought along illustrator Aidan Koch to help evolve her connection to this study site into a full scale, multidisciplinary exposition. This trip resulted in a 250-page publication<i> </i>that includes writing, interviews and illustrations. Lisa also composed a new set of compositions based on the soundscapes in the habitats they visited, and these were recently premiered by her evolving collaboration, Secret Drum Band, in Portland.</p>
