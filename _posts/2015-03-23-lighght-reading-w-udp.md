<p>The Sunview Luncheonette is a restaurant, performance space, and storefront social club in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Founded in 1963, it has served the community as a microvenue for art, poetics, workshops, lectures, plays, readings, and music. The back room doubles as a studio and incubator for the design, publication, and distribution of printed ephemera.</p>
<p>*<br />
Lighght Reading is a bi-monthly reading and performance series curated and hosted by <a href="http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/">UDP</a> editors and authors. The series features emerging poets and performers and underexposed writing in translation, often pairing a writer or translator associated with <a href="http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/">UDP</a> with readers and performers from other communities. All events are free and open to the public. Limited-edition broadsides, letter pressed at the <a href="http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/">UDP</a> studio, accompany each reading.</p>
