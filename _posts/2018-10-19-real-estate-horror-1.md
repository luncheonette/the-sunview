Come by the luncheonette this Friday, October 19, for the first screening in a
series on Real Estate Horror. We're starting with the original version of *The
Amityville Horror* from 1979, directed by Stuart Rosenberg. We'll talk about
about what distinguishes real estate horror from the more traditional examples
of the haunted house film, and how the trope of "the terrible place" is
re-configured into "the horror movie as economic nightmare" in the wake the
1970s recession. Also, we will drink beers and eat snacks while we watch. And
pause it if we need to figure stuff out together. Hangouts at 7:00, screening
at 8:00-ish.

Also!
10/29: Real Estate Horror II: *The Possession of Joel Delaney*, dir. Waris Hussein, 1972

11/2: Real Estate Horror III: *Wolfen*, dir. Micheal Wadleigh, 1981

...and then more to come...
