<p>Meet Xavier Luján, editor at <b>flamingo publications</b> (Venezuela / New York) and Sebastiaan Hanekroot, technical director of <b>Colour &amp; Books</b> (The Netherlands) over drinks and conversation.</p>
<p>We’ll have a variety of photobooks to rifle through and and a few to sell.  Come take a look!  Should be quite easy and fun!</p>

<p>And for you members, this’ll be the first of a series of photo nights that I’m hosting - let me know if you’re interested and what kind of stuff you’d be interested in seeing (more books, artist talks, archives, technical directions, etc etc).<br />
Hope you can make it!</p>
