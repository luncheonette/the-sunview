Collectif presents the first exhibition "Designated" at the art center and
diner Sunview Luncheonette, in Greenpoint (Brooklyn).

Designated - The Exhibition is born. For this first edition, Collectif presents
three media makers, artists and filmmakers - Zoya Baker, Candace Thompson and
Marine G. Brun-Franzetti - who is co-founder of Collectif and curator of the
show. Designated invites the viewers to question their human condition and
behaviors in an environment affected by climate change.

ZOYA BAKER - “Memory Herbarium” (Photographs and AR)<br>
Memory Herbarium is an interactive installation that invites human participants
to collaborate with wild plants and contribute to an archive of images
co-created by plants and humans. Augmented reality plants emerge at the site of
ethnobotanical communion.<br>

CANDACE THOMPSON - The C.U.R.B (Projection)<br>
The C.U.R.B. is an interdisciplinary art and activism project that reconnects
urbanites with our fragile (and oft-displaced) food web in the face of oncoming
climate change.<br>
