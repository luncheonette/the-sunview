<div style="font-size:.9;margin-top:-45px;margin-bottom:25px"><em>Image: still from</em> Afternoon with John<em> by Michelle Levy, 2013</em></div>
<p>Dear Friends of the Sunview Luncheonette,</p>
<p>I invite you to join us for an evening devoted to memory, poetic associations, and<br />
the senses.</p>
<p>Five wines have been selected especially for you by Brooklyn-based sommelier<br />
Jonathan Walton. He would be there to tell you about them himself, but he is in New<br />
Zealand crushing Pinot Noir.</p>
<p>Instead he has left me his tasting notes to share with you and from his notes I have<br />
chosen five performances, each carefully paired with a wine for you to experience as<br />
you swirl, sniff, and sip.</p>
<p><strong>Featuring:</strong><br />
<a href="https://janecarver.bandcamp.com/">Jane Carver</a><br />
<a href="http://markgolamco.com/">Mark Golamco</a><br />
<a href="http://www.michelle-levy.com/">Michelle Levy</a><br />
<a href="http://www.brooklynrail.org/contributor/laura-raicovich">Laura Raicovich</a><br />
<a title="Food Project People’s Kitchen" href="http://thesunview.org/food-project-peoples-kitchen/">Zuzanna Juszkiewicz</a></p>
<p><em>And</em></p>
<p>One white wine, a rose, two reds, and a sherry.</p>
<p>Although I am inviting you as my guests, I will ask that you chip in about $10 each for the wine, and maybe a little cheese.</p>
<p>If you would like to attend, please <a href="mailto:sally.o.szwed@gmail.com">RSVP here</a> and I will write back to confirm that there is a seat for you.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p>Sally Szwed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
