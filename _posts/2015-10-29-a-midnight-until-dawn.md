<p><i>A midnight until dawn</i> is a screening of video works by living artists for which considerations of race, ethnicity and/or social class are integral parts of their practice. In some, but not all cases, the influences of anime, sci-fi, and magical thinking are apparent in the selected works. Sunview Luncheonette offers the rare opportunity to view these pieces, together, in an intimate setting, with friends.</p>

<i>Biological Community </i>(excerpt)<br />
r/t 1 min</p>
<p>Tang-Wei Hsu (1980 born in Taiwan) currently lives and works in New York. He obtained a BA in Architecture at the Shih Chien University and finished an MFA in Visual Arts at the Tainan National University of the Arts. His paintings begin from an imagined fantasy space extending into installation, sculpture and public art.</p>
<p>Tang-Wei creates complex drawings as well as mixed media installations composed of his drawings, paintings, and architectural features. He often alludes to nature in his work and interprets physical features of our universe like the stars and astronomy, either at close range or at a distance. By combining his fanciful worlds with practical architectural features he asks us to suspend our disbelief and to embrace his fantasy terrains and enjoy them as part of our everyday surroundings.<br />
Those works hope to produce the relationship between the miniature and enormous scale in his paintings. Different layers from the painting produce many relationships, in order to make this imaginary space or scene are fantastic as outer space, every statuses of every distance are compressed into the flat paintings. Also extends the new imagine and fantasy from this space, by creating some clustered symbols in an artificial way, to make it feels like some unknown biology, biological unit, and various imagination of scenes.</p>

r/t 4.10 mins</p>
<p>A post-apocalyptic world where memory haunts and reality confuses.</p>

<i>Somewhere only we know</i><br />
2009<br />
r/t 5.15</p>
<p>Standing on the brink of elimination, the suspense threatening to fracture their composure, contestants wait and see if they will be going home. The audience at home is also waiting... Part two of <i>Bearing Witness Trilogy</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bearing Witness</i> is a trilogy concerned with how we, as a culture, watch ourselves, especially in moments of great emotional significance. With footage culled from mainstream media and television, the single-channel videos (The Eternal Quarter Inch, Somewhere only we know, The Burning Blue) distill moments of sincerity from perhaps insincere sources (televangelists, reality show contestants, screensavers, B-movies). This trilogy puts pressure on the infrastructure of distributing images, particularly those that represent what might have normally been private experiences made public for the sake of entertainment. Located in interstitial spaces, these videos continually shift the role of the viewer between voyeur and participant.</p>
<p>Jesse McLean is a media artist utilizing collage both aesthetically and conceptually. Her video work employs highly recognizable appropriated material alongside more elusive sources and material generated by the artist. Motivated by a deep curiosity about human behavior and relationships, her work is concerned with both the power and the failure of the mediated experience to bring people together. Recent videos put pressure not only on the relationships that develop between viewer and subject, but also on the ways emotions are lived in an age of mediated experience. She has presented her work at museums, galleries, and film festivals worldwide, including the Mumok Cinema in Vienna, International Film Festival Rotterdam, Views from the Avant Garde at the New York Film Festival, CPH:DOX, Kassel Dokfest, Impakt, and the Contemporary Art Museum, St. Louis. She was the recipient of an International Critics Prize, (FIPRESCI Prize) at the Internationale Kurzfilmtage Oberhausen and a Jury Prize in the International Competition at the 2013 Videoex Festival. Her recent video I’m in Pittsburgh and It’s Raining was awarded first prize at the Onion City Experimental Film and Video Festival. She was a featured artist at the 2014 Flaherty Seminar.</p>

<i>Give and Take</i><br />
r/t 3 mins</p>
<p>The concept and title of the animation <i>Give and Take</i> derives from a rare tree species native to Central America. The tree contains both a powerful toxin and its own antidote. The work is a creative expedition on the complex cycles of nature and the ineffable spirit of the black woman’s body.</p>
<p>Introducing a visual language that reveals the complexity and nuanced spectrum of black womanhood: from innocence, awareness, to maturity. Using drawing and time-based techniques to narrate the phases of self–discovery. Layering elements found in creation myths and self-defining identity narratives to experiment with a matriarchal character that reclaims, recovers, and recasts her image.</p>
<p><i>Give and Take</i> weaves’ concepts of nature and science with objects and practices rooted in the African-Caribbean Diasporan tradition to create my fantastical interpretation of an origin myth.</p>
<p><b>Shervone Neckles</b> is a Caribbean-American raised in Brooklyn, New York to Grenadian parents.

<p><strong>Jacolby Satterwhite</strong><br />
<em>Reifying Desire 6</em><br />
2014<br />
r/t 20 mins</p>
<p>Jacolby Satterwhite's video works bring together 3-D animation, drawings, and live performance to construct utopian digital worlds. Within this uncharted digital architecture, Satterwhite explores personal history, identity and memory. Satterwhite often incorporates personal sources such as his mother's drawings, which he hand-traces and imports into 3D animation programs to build lush, computer-generated landscapes. Into these digital realms he inserts multiple elaborately costumed avatars, whose kinetic gestures compose a sensual physical choreography. Fusing pop culture, subculture, and art history in his video work and performance, Satterwhite creates visually dazzling tableaux that reflect the changing spatial and bodily anxieties and desires of the digital world. Satterwhite's computer-generated realms densely layered with proliferating drawings, objects and performances encompass animated narratives of personal memory and identity.</p>
<p>He has exhibited at the 2014 Whitney Biennial, Studio Museum in Harlem, Bronx AIM Biennial, New Frontiers at the Sundance Film Festival, and is represented by OHWOW Gallery in Los Angeles. He has an MFA from University of Pennsylvania, has studied at Skowhegan School for Painting and Sculpture and Maryland Institute College of Arts, and  has received awards and residencies from Louis Comfort Tifanny Grant, Art Matters, Headlands, Center for Arts, LMCC Workspace, and Provincetown Fine Arts Works Center, among others. His work is in the permanent collections of institutions including The Whitney Museum of American Art, Seattle Art Museum, and Studio Museum in Harlem.</p>

<p><strong>Leslie Thornton</strong><br />
<i>Peggy and Fred in Hell: The Prologue</i><br />
1985<br />
r/t 20:00</p>
<p>Leslie Thornton is a painter turned video- and filmmaker who teaches in the Modern Culture and Media Program at Brown University. Her lush, complex works explore the mechanisms of desire and meaning, while probing past the boundaries of language and narrative conventions.  Difficult to categorize or describe, Thornton’s works are steeped in theoretical interest and filled with rich and intuitive imagery in experimental narratives crossing science fiction, ethnographic, and documentary forms.</p>
<p><i>Peggy And Fred In Hell </i>is one of the strangest cinematic artifacts of the last 20 years, revealing the abuses of history and innocence in the face of catastrophe, as it chronicles two small children journeying through a post-apocalyptic landscape to create their own world. Breaking genre restrictions, Thornton uses improvisation, planted quotes, archival footage and formless timeframes to confront the viewer's preconceptions of cause and effect.</p>
<p>"At its most distinctive, as in the endless and eternal Peggy And Fred In Hell cycle, Thornton’s work wanders past the medium’s limits and finds the medium’s origins.” —Bill Horrigan, Wexner Center</p>
