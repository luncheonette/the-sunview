Following 18 months of analysis and planning, NCA will present our findings and visions for a city-owned property running alongside the Creek.  The meeting is open to everyone, food and refreshments provided.  More info about the planning process <a href="http://www.newtowncreekalliance.org/north-henry-street-event/">on the NCA site</a>.</p>
