Please come by the luncheonette tomorrow, Friday, April 21, at 7:00PM for:
ARTIST-HORROR II, The Man Who Could Cheat Death. A sculptor murders his models
in the pursuit of a serum that will grant him eternal youth. A somewhat obscure
Hammer film from 1959 with shades of Dorian Gray, plus more
artist-as-enervating force, fake art destruction, and more. Free pizza, free
beer. Hangouts at 7, Film at 8
