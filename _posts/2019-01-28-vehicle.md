Vehicle is a monthly meeting where a group of artists and other interested
practitioners get together, drink, munch, and have candid conversations about
the work they produce.

The first meeting will take place on Monday January 28 at 7pm

The Sunview Luncheonette<br>
221 Nassau Street, Brooklyn NY 11222

**

Lasse Lau will present his work-in-progress, "Sound from the Towers." This
video constitutes the third in a trilogy by Lau that includes "Sound from the
Hallways" (2012) and "STEMâ€”Sound of the Tropics" (2017). Each work investigates
the impact of sound on space, and traces forgotten histories among the ruins of
modernity and colonialism.

Lasse Lau (1974, Denmark) is an award-winning visual artist and filmmaker who
looks at the spatial dimension of power to better understand society's social
struggles. His work addresses challenges and pitfalls in the relational and
representational capitalist monolithic readings of space.
