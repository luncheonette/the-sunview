This petition calls upon Mayor Deblasio, New York City Council Members, and
Speaker Mark-Viverito to unequivocally support the Small Business Jobs
Survival Act (File #: Int 0402-2014), the only real solution to ensure that
we are saving our small business jobs and local economy by allowing our small
business owners the right to:
A 10 year minimum lease, with equal negotiating power as the landlord for new terms
An end to rent-gouging and exorbitant rent increases.

More stuff would be here...
