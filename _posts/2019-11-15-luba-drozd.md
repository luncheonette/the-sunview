Saturday 11/16 from noon to 10:00pm

Inspired by the European folk tale about the value of sharing with strangers,
Luba Drozd’s Stone Soup will celebrate the soundings of the Sunview
Luncheonette’s architecture, objects and purpose with a uniquely site-specific
installation. The work will turn the Sunview—a once family-operated diner that
is now a member-run cooperative space for art and poetics—into a vibrating,
humming drone environment. Layers of cooking stone sounds and 3D animated
projections will interact with materials which in turn modulate the sound on
the counters, booths and kitchen space. Using cookware, stones, pots, plates,
piano strings, vibrations and projection as materials, Drozd will animate the
diner’s objects, and sound its ongoing history and community.
