verily: a launch party for Ian Dreiblatt’s “how to hide by showing in the age
of being alone with the universe,” out now from above/ground press.

the book has been described by no one in particular as a “pixelated ceremonial
mace flickering in and out of existence, an imaginary of the imagination
devouring itself only to reveal the ineluctability of imagination itself, a
delicately carved amethyst spoon in which to endure the apogee of mental
relaxation.” it’s smallish and orange and hopefully you will like it.

readers include:

Nicole Wallace<br>
Eugene Lim<br>
Anna Gurton-Wachter<br>
Ian Dreiblatt<br>

please join us! there will be foods to eat, dranks to drank, genial good
spirits, lively bleak commentary, chapbooks for sale (hoo ah), and, perhaps,
the occasional joke.

the sunview luncheonette is a gorgeous small craft of survival and contains actual phone booths.
