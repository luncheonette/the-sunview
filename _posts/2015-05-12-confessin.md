Collecting confessions for a show to air on the STROBE Network, a television-channel-as-exhibition premiering at Flux Factory this June.If there is anything you've ever wanted to say to someone but didn't have the chance, the guts, or the safety to do so, this may be your lucky day. Come to the Sunview Luncheonette on Sunday evenings in May. Have a couple of drinks, duck inside a phone booth, and get whatever it is off your chest. It might be an apology. A tirade. A wish. A memory. Anything plaguing your guilty conscience. Anything you need to talk about that your friends are tired of hearing about. (You will be recorded, but your voice will be disguised, and your confession will remain anonymous.)
