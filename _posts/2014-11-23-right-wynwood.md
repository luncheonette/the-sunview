<p><a href="http://596acres.org">596 Acres</a>, Sunview Luncheonette &amp; the <a href="http://interferencearchive.org">Interference Archive</a> present a film and conversation on art outside and the right to shape our neighborhoods.</p>
<p><a href="http://righttowynwood.wordpress.com/"><strong>Right to Wynwood</strong></a> is an investigative documentary that explores the causes and effects of gentrification in Wynwood, Miami FL. Through interviews with developers, gallerists, artists, community leaders, and members of the local Puerto Rican population, Right to Wynwood seeks to tell the story of how Wynwood went from Miami's oldest Puerto Rican community to its largest art district, and what that means for the future of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The film is 22 minutes long and will screen promptly at 8:20pm.</p>
<p>There will be appropriate snacks and a conversation with <a href="http://www.nikisingletonstudio.com/"><strong>Niki Singleton</strong></a> and <a href="http://onthelowerfrequencies.com/bio/"><strong>Erick Lyle</strong></a> after the film.</p>
<p>We'll check in on our Brooklyn reality. If you're a painter of walls or a builder of houses or an eater of food or a dreamer of futures, please join us!</p>
