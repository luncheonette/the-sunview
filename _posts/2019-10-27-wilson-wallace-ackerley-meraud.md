**Tavi Meraud** is an artist originally from NYC and, after a nomadic period,
rediscovering their home. This exercise of wayfinding and the expanded sense of
positionality informs much of their current work. Tavi has published and shown
work in different contexts including: Field Guide to Skirmology as part of the
e-flux Supercommunity at the Venice Biennale (2015), e-flux Love Reader (2017),
aCCeSsions Journal 4 (2018), “Behind the Seen” NARS Foundation Residency Season
III group show (2019).

This fall/winter, in addition to Memory Mondegreen, Tavi has work in the
upcoming Lishui Photography Festival in China, group show on Time at Jack
Hanley Gallery as well as contributions to the publication accompanying the
Time show and the Hoosac Institute Journal 4. They are also currently working
on a new body of interdisciplinary installation and performance based work
developed around their recent Iridescene Manifesto (2019, available upon
request) as well as an artist book project on memory, perception and
dislocation.

In the past decade, **Jessica Ackerley** has already established herself on the
Canadian and American rock and jazz scene as a unique guitarist, composer and
band leader. Born and raised in Alberta, Canada; Jessica now resides in New
York city where she has worked alongside notable musicians such as Tyshawn
Sorey and Martin Bisi (Sonic Youth, Herbie Hancock, John Zorn). She as had the
opportunity to perform at established venues like John Zorn’s The Stone, The
Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Blue Note, as well as tours as both a band
leader and sideman throughout Canada and the United States.

Her musical palette is diverse, drawing from highly refined compositional
structure to free improvisation and jazz, with a slight nod to no wave and
Avant Garde soundscapes. ***All About Jazz*** has stated upon the release of her
acclaimed  debut album that, *"her work demonstrates her independence and refusal
to conform, yet it is rooted firmly in that which has influenced her. If she
maintains this course, Ackerley has a brilliant career ahead of her."* Jessica
continuously tries to expand her musical horizons with various projects across
Canada and the U.S. In August, 2019, Ackerley released her follow-up sophomore
album, A New Kind of Water, recorded at BC Studios (John Zorn, Sonic Youth)
with Martin Bisi.
