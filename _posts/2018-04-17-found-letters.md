I hope to see you Saturday for a thing I've wanted to do for a while.  I'll be reading found letters written from one young man to another in the 1960's.  Come join us to find out about Myles Weiner and Kenneth Bernstein and speculate about Brooklyn in the mid 20th century, male friendship, the shadowy events hinted at in this correspondence, the nature of the written letter, and what exactly is Myles' problem.  We'll have snacks and ginger tea; BYOB.
