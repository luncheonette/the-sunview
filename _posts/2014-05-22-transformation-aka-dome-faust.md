<p>Dome Theatre's latest play, Transformation, comes to you under the airs. The story of one tempted by one,a soul let go at a very cheap price, the familiar one, a man unscienced, a woman made of Light, a mangy unseen dog, a fluorescent Plant, and a crowd of Vegetables. All placed in an overheated Tavern that serves up Injustice and Swill. </p>
