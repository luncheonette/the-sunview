<p>Ever wondered how to run a farm?</p>
<p>609CSA/Star Route Farm's own Tianna Kennedy join us to talk about managing a multi-layered organic farming practice in New York State.</p>
<p>Tianna says:</p>
<p>"what is a csa anyway?and what does it look like to run a farm? or rather, I'll try to answer those questions."</p>
<p><strong>Tianna Kennedy</strong> is co-owner of Star Route Farm and founder/manager of the 607 csa.  She lived a myriad of past lives in Tucson, Arizona, the Bay Area, Nottingham, England and Brooklyn, New York, but has been farming in the Catskills for seven years, now.  She is beyond thrilled with this year's crew.</p>
<p>A club night talk.</p>
