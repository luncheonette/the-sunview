<p>We are pleased to announce  2MF’s first meeting of 2016:<br />
<i><b>January 16, 2016, 2 PM<br />
</b></i><i><b>Sunview Luncheonette<br />
</b></i><i><b>221 Nassau Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11222</b></i></p>
<p>Bethany Ides will lead a discussive-immersive enhancement for tender-knotting internettedness, thinking about communitarian soap opera, playing school &amp; eating cereal.<br />
Please take note of the study materials below, as they will be part of the discussion:<br />
Fred Rogers, "Spoon Mountain Opera" (1982)Steven Connor, "Collective Emotions: Reasons to Feel Doubtful" (2013)<br />
(Refreshments will be served)</p>
<p>Bethany Ides sets precarious parameters wherein roles &amp; resources play actors &amp; places as if everything extends itself uncertainly.  In 2014, she founded DOORS UNLIMITED, a roving vessel for investigative operatics that proliferates communitarian-collaborative strategies for provisional-conditional experimenting with/in soap opera, encampment opera, opera-within-opera, telephonic inter-drama, dismantlement, dialectics, days &amp; nights &amp; both as neither, near-death, opera in bed, opera in spite of itself, opera in excess of itself, ante-institutional operatic allusions, elations, protrusions, performance, sticks, schools, stone squares, soggy cereal blankets, very long songs, backlog, tending tender tendencies, like water, underwater, fake hair, carpet squares, contact paper, play mats, flooded currency, fluidity, liquid plumber, uncertainty.</p>
<p>Her multi-phasic, month-long opera, <i>Transient’s Theme, </i>premiered at the Knockdown Center in 2014, following a 2-month connective-convective convocation or composition involving 80 participants at a campground in the Catskills.  Ides’ performance or installation-as-proposition work has also been presented for/at Mandragoras Art Space (MAAS), Fragmental Museum, St. Marks Poetry Project, St. Francis College, Dixon Place, the Brooklyn Museum, &amp; the Gershwin Hotel (as if there is only New York), but also lots of other places in other cities, &amp; for BOMB Magazine’s Instagram account.  Additionally, she co-curates occasional festivals that often have an air of counter-purpose to them, co-writes articles on minor peculiarities related to sound or film, co-edits a series of fugitive anthologies, harmonizes readily, &amp; partners in movement with wonderful, really wonderful people for real &amp; wonderful occasions too starry to count out because they are lit gleaming enough, luckily, to constitute really gladness.  She is perennial artist-in-residence at the Prattsville Art Center &amp; soon also at SenseLab in Montreal.  Ides teaches at Pratt, Bard, SVA, &amp; SUNY-Albany, &amp; is being taught a lot.</p>
<p><b>About 2MF:</b><br />
2MF is an artist project led by Sonya Derman and Maria Stabio. It is determined to promote pro-emotive and anti-academic conversation among artists living dis/contentedly in the un/ranked spaces in New York City.<br />
2MF takes action in two parts: monthly meetings facilitated by artists focusing on content relevant to their interests (&amp; messy permutations in the lived world), alongside a radio show/podcast hosted by Clocktower Radio in Red Hook, Brooklyn. All meetings are open to the public, and we encourage newcomers to join. Meeting details will always be posted at our website, www.2manyfeelings.com.</p>
