<h2><strong>1. </strong></h2>
<p>The first (semi-regular) RECORD HANG is happeningÂ this Saturday noon-4p. There's gonna be some coffee (donated from Variety Coffee), and an armload of records. I will be featuring side one of Miles Davis' soundtrack for the film Jack Johnson, odd albums from the back catalog of Memphis' Ardent Studios (Big Star's label), and selections from China Crisis, Prefab Sprout, Link Wray, Iggy, The 5 Royales, Barefoot Jerry, Brian Hyland and a few of Bea's Greek pop 45's.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to play some records, maybe you want to sell some, maybe you want a coffee? ($1 donation goes to La Luncheonette)<br />
!RECORD HANG!</p>
<h2><strong>2.</strong></h2>
<p>Records and coffee continues tomorrow--noon to 5p. Continental breakfast, Dylan making books in the back, and Colin Bluntstone's highly underrated solo album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZt7RSyOAMk">Journey</a> will be featured.</p>
