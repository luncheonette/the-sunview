**Nitin Mukul** (born in Lawrence, Massachusetts) is a visual artist based in
Queens, NYC. His practice lead him to bridge video and painting, arriving at a
new format for experiencing a painting as a durational event. He named the
process ‘durational painting’. These works begin by layering paint in sheets of
ice, freezing each layer of media so that they accumulate layers of color and
texture. Placing the frozen mass outside or in a room, he allows it to melt
according to natural weather conditions, filming the process with a tight zoom.
This series continues to evolve: as instruments reflecting ambient conditions
of the site they are made in: light, temperature, time of day, location, our
climate at large, historic resonance, and as a new context for understanding
the practice of abstract painting that calls for deep viewing and appreciating
the potential of materials used to act with their own agency. He recently
lectured about his work at RISD, and presented new work at the ICA
Philadelphia. In 2020 he will be an Artist In Residence at the Caldera Arts
Center in Sisters, Oregon. In 2019 he completed video installations at Pioneer
Works, Brooklyn and Lincoln Center, NYC, and exhibits with Aicon Gallery, NYC.
