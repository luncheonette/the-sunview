Please come out to the luncheonette this Sunday for ARTIST-HORROR IX: The
Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian Gray wreaks
psychological havoc on the sitter while he roams around London indulging in
depravity and murder. This is a kind of inverted ARTWORK-HORROR movie, yet we
must grapple with it all the more so. George Sanders as Lord Henry! Free pizza,
free beer, hangouts at 7, film at 8.
