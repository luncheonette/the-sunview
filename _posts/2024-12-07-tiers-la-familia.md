We're ready to get experimental on December 7th, so we will be — TLF'N'U —
that's right, you’re invited to jam with us! Please bring an acoustically
audible instrument to join in on the second part of the set. Percussive and
vocal vibes are strongly encouraged.

We'll start the night with a short set by Tamio Shiraishi followed by some
mixed collabs and solo pieces from the TLF band (Ian Bjornstad, Cheryl Kingan,
Joe Sidney, Jeff Tobias), so don’t be late!

Sunview is gracious enough to house this community experiment, and we plan to
have some food/drinks to share, a donation bucket, TLF and you.
