<p>This workshop/discussion group will provide an introduction to philosophical alchemy through a close reading of Michael Maier's 1617 emblem book <i>Atalanta Fugiens</i>. The alchemical androgyne represents the highest goal and attainment of the alchemical processes and we will discuss the symbology, poetics, and politics of such transformative and transforming images in the context of this book and esoteric thought in general. Arguably one of the earliest "multimedia" texts, combining image, poetry, theory and music, <i>Atlanta Fugiens </i>is a rich node for a variety of weird practices and hermetic theories, with underground affiliations networked across the void from ancient times to today.</p>
<p>We will meet for 3 two-hour sessions, with a possibility of extending: Sept 16, 23 and October 7th at 7 PM.<br />
