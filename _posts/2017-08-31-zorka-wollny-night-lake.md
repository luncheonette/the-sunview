<p>"A Night by the Lake"<br />
A series of contemplative sound workshops with Polish artist and composer Zorka Wollny.</p>
<p>Workshops are open for all who would like to discover the power of the voice and the pleasure of collective improvisation.</p>
<p>We will explore sounds coming from everyday life – noises made by human bodies, objects, those created involuntarily when engaging in more or less casual activities such as chatting, walking, laughing, sighing, rubbing things onto each other. What interests us most is how such actions, when made by a group of people, change the quality of sound from obvious to indefinable.</p>
<p>Together we will create a short concert that can transport the listeners far away from the noise of New York, to the mysterious world of alienated noises, cracks, hums and whispers, hard to define and yet very close.</p>
