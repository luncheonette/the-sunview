<p>Come this Sunday for Winter Solstice, preceded by an <a href="http://theseainthedark.org/portfolio/emfa/">electromagnetic field sound-walk</a> through the local Zone, and followed by a screening of Tarkovsky's 1979 chef-d'œuvre Stalker with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/stalker.jpg">these people</a> and a hot kettle of borscht.</p>
<p>Details: Meet at Sunview at 4:00 PM for a drift through the wintery IBZ, examining the acoustic ecology of its electromagnetic fields.  Back to the Sunview by 7 P for warming soup and solstice rituals.</p>
