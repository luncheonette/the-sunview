Hello. This Friday please join Shelby and Chad for:



We Need to Talk About Jane

An evening to define self-respect within the hell that is love and lies. 



"I must resist those who punish me unjustly." -- Jane Eyre



7:00p -- Jane Eyre, (1934) dir. Christy Cabanne (and some food)

8:30p -- round-table discussion about Jane Eyre

9:30p -- Jane Eyre, (1943) dir. Robert Stevenson

11:15p -- attempt to come to terms with Jane's example from this moment on, until we shed our mortal coils, for ourselves and others, who will follow us...
