A long poem, the Unlovable is forthcoming on Troll Thread Press. His first solo show, "Looking for Richard" was displayed last year at Ginerva Gambino, (Cologne, DE). Other work can be found on GaussPDF, Troll Thread, and elsewhere on the internet. He is also a PhD Candidate at New York University.</p>

<p>Keiko Uenishi. Currently splitting time between Brooklyn, New York and Vienna, Austria, sound art-i-vist, socio/environ composer, Keiko Uenishi is known for her works formed through experiments in restructuring and analyzing one's relationship with sounds in sociological, cultural, and/or psychological environments. She is obsessed with questioning and re-imagining the definitions of space through aural perceptions. Uenishi is currently working on a doctoral research titled “Partitions: Dividers, Connectors, Gray-zones, Neighbours in Aural Space,” for which she collaborates with people in Brooklyn, NY; Vienna, Austria; Maebashi, Gunma, Japan. She is also a core member of SHARE.nyc (http://share.dj/share) since 2001. More info &gt;&gt; <a href="http://soundleak.org/">http://soundleak.org/</a></p>
<p>Theresa Columbus is a performance artist and playwright and filmmaker. For the last 20 years she has performed extensively in Baltimore and Milwaukee, and has toured the country primarily performing poetic plays. Plays where people talk in a way that addresses becoming close to each other or to others, or talk in interesting poems to each other, or think and talk about the way things strongly feel, occasionally bursting into experimental singing and choreography. She has made, co-directed, and acted in many film and video projects, which are often about the act of storytelling, the connections it produces, and the bizarreness of how we expect stories to unfold. She also collectively started and ran an experimental performance space called Darling Hall for 5 years in Milwaukee, WI. <a href="http://theresacolumbus.com/">http://theresacolumbus.com/</a></p>
<p>Ray Ferreira ¿wenami?• blk latinx de queens. Their performative practice uses iridescence, movement, projection, repetition, and *~-~~*quantum poetics*~~-~* to create a banj criticallity:turnup w/the gurls and swerve past white cishet patriarchy that indetermina(c). They can be located museum educating at the Studio Museum in Harlem, as well as floating through other museum education departments. Other intersections of space, time, and matter include ITINERANT (at the Glasshouse), La MaMA, and various additional intra-actions.</p>
