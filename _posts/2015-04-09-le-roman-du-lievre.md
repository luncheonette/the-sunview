<p><strong>Jimmy Riordan</strong> will read from his translation of Francis Jammes' turn of the century fable, focusing on those parts dedicated to describing where various animals go when they die.</p>
<p>Le Roman du Lièvre is the story of a hare who, under the direction of Saint Francis of Assisi, leads a pack of animals to heaven in search of paradise. In 2008 Jimmy Riordan translated Le Roman du Lièvre from French into English. At the time he did not know any french. Last summer, after over five years working around the text, he finally printed his translation.</p>
