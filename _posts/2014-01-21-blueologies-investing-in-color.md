<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<p>After over a year and a half of showing Elite Art in Los Angeles as Gauthier Bowman Gallery, Gauthier Gallery is pleased to announce its inaugural effort, Blueologies: Investing in Color, a group exhibition featuring artists from Los Angeles and New York, whose recent works challenge the limitations of a singular color—blue. Through diverse media, from painting and drawing to photography and poetry, these artists seek to both understand and complicate the meaning of the color which resides between “violet” and “green” on our visible spectrum. As philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote in his seminal text Theory of Colors, “We love to contemplate blue. Not because it advances to us, but because it draws us after it.”</p>
<p>We are extremely honored to present what is certain to be an enlightening panel discussion, featuring Color Expert and Sotheby’s Art Advisor, Mark Oberhoff.</p>
<p>Featured artists:<br />
Tyler Akers, New York<br />
Baby Paper, New York<br />
Christine Haroutounian, Los Angeles<br />
Devin Kenny, Los Angeles / New York<br />
Carmel Ni, Los Angeles<br />
Elizabeth Sultzer, New York<br />

<p>A printed companion to the exhibition will follow, with written works by Taylor Hunter, Kaitlyn A. Kramer, Lauren McQuade, Amelia Rina, Elizabeth Sultzer, and Hannes Wallace.</p>
