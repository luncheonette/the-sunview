"All great, simple images reveal a psychic state. The house, even more than
the landscape, is a "psychic state," and even when reproduced as it appears
from the outside, it bespeaks intimacy."\\
–Gaston Bachelard

The home is the beginning of everything. It is the site of many of our
'firsts' in life, and is an early proving ground for those important events
which occur later, elsewhere. Our first senses of love, war, betrayal, peace,
joy and grief happen in the home, alongside our first understanding of our
sense of seeing, tasting, touching, smelling and hearing.

Beginning as a second womb, the home shifts to accommodate our changing
expectations of our lives and ourselves. Such a protean space also provides a
remarkable framework for the creation of meaning and the spinning of
narratives. We will look at how Gaston Bachelard's conception of the house as
psychic space works remarkably well as a vehicle for both psychological
introspection as well as storytelling. David Batchelor's Chromophobia will
provide a jumping-off point for a discussion about how the decoration of the
home, with a special focus on color, creates meaning and connects to issues of
class and race.

Some particularly domestic (though not at all comfortable) film clips will
lead the way into a game where groups create their own narratives for a given
interior or interiors.
