**Middle Ground: (Im)possible Kitchen**

What happens when people with different cultural, religious, and ethical food
restrictions try to make a meal together?

Join us for a unique workshop where we’ll explore stories of exclusion,
identity, and togetherness through food. Participants will share their personal
dietary experiences, identify limitations, and collaboratively cook a meal that
respects everyone’s needs—no one left out.

Through open conversation and collective cooking, we’ll ask: Is an inclusive
meal truly possible? And how can food become a medium for empathy and
connection?

Date & Time<br>
**Friday, August 8, 2025 at 6:00 PM**<br>
**The Sunview Luncheonette**<br>
**257 Nassau Ave, Brooklyn, NY**<br>
Join us for an art & food workshop exploring inclusive eating through shared
cooking, storytelling, and the invention of “impossible” recipes that respect
everyone’s dietary needs. 

**Who Should Join**<br>
Anyone with food-related restrictions (religious, ethical, cultural, or
medical), and anyone passionate about food, cooking, and inclusive communities.
No professional experience is needed—just a willingness to share and learn.
**Especially for those who love to cook or create with food.**

Participatory cooking, talking, shared meal
