<p>This fall and winter, <a href="http://artsandlabor.org/alternative-economies/">Arts &amp; Labor’s Alternative Economies Working Group</a> will be convening at <strong>Sunview Luncheonette</strong> to discuss the cultural-political landscape in New York City. We invite artists, activists, cultural workers, community members, and anyone who is interested in joining our "think tank" and brainstorm on how we can work together to find solutions to our current situation.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us in this first session for casual group discussion and activities over shared food and drink. As a starting point we'll discuss the current conditions that affect us as cultural workers and community members, and think about what a radical and inclusive cultural plan for New York City might look like. Let's combine our knowledge, experience, and relationships to formulate creative solutionsand strengthen existing efforts to secure our right to the city.<br />
<strong>All are welcome.</strong> Please email Alternative Economies at <a href="mailto:al.altecon@gmail.com">al.altecon@gmail.com</a> if you plan to attend or have any questions.</p>

<strong>About Sunview Luncheonette:</strong></p>
<p>The Sunview Luncheonette is a storefront on pause; a member-based social club; a microvenue for art, poetics, regionalism, mutual aid, and commoning. The Luncheonette performs semi-public dinners, talks, work-shops, lectures, plays, reading groups, and musical interludes in a semi-private setting. It is resistant to traditional forms of commerce, commodification, and gentrification. It is above all, an “approach,” and least of all, an “outcome.” It is unknown. It is hopeful. It saves you a seat at the counter.</p>
