<p>CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS<br />
Friday, January 29, let us initiate a series of symposia that will allow us to better grok the horrors of global neoliberal capitalism. I propose we begin by considering chairs.</p>
<p>This is will be a LITERAL SYMPOSIUM, i.e. a drinking party, wherein each of us will take a turn addressing the subject of chairs. Presentations should be somewhere between 1 second and 20 minutes. Visual aids are strenuously encouraged. All members and guests are invited to present on topics that might include:</p>
<p>-Chairs as signifiers of Western modernity in the films of Yasujiro Ozu<br />
-"Chairs suck, I fucking hate them."<br />
-Donald Rumsfeld does not use chairs at his desk, he literally just stands there<br />
-Do we have enough chairs?<br />
-Donald Judd's tortuous narrativization of his chairs as boundary anxiety<br />
-Chairs, death and modernity: from using them as a way to get your head into the noose at a sufficient elevation to hang yourself to charging them with tons of electricity to kill incarcerated citizens<br />
-famous chairs of the Sunview luncheonette: a brief history<br />
-most of the chairs for sale at Staples have wheels<br />
-Duchamp's <i>Bicycle Wheel</i> and Beuys' <i>Fat Chair</i>: valuable art-chairs made by famous male artists that have been thrown away by cleaning women<br />
-maybe someone can just read the section on commodity fetishism from <i>Capital</i> while showing a fucking chair on the screen?</p>
<p>PLEASE COME AND SHARE YOUR IDEAS, OPINIONS AND FEELINGS ABOUT CHAIRS!</p>
<p>Maybe someone will drunkenly stumble into the room during our symposium just like Alcibiades, that would <i>so</i> rule!</p>
<p>THIS IS GOING TO LOOK <i><b>KILLER</b></i> ON YOUR CV</p>
