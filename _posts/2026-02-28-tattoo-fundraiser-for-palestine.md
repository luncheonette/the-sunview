[Mabsoot Manaeesh](https://www.instagram.com/mabsootmanaeesh/) is putting on a
fundraiser for Palestine this Saturday the 28th from 10am-6pm. 

[Middle Son Tattoo](https://www.middlesontattoo.com/) will be tattooing flash of
the flora and fauna native to Palestine and Mabsoot Manaeesh will have food and
other wares for purchase - all proceeds will go towards direct aid for folks in
Gaza. Tattoos are first come, first serve - but come for the food, the company,
the cause, even if you don't want to get inked up!
