The Sunview Luncheonette is hosting a marathon reading of Monique Wittig’s last
novel Across the Acheron (1985), recently republished in a revised translation
by [Winter
Editions](https://www.wintereditions.net/product/across-the-acheron/).  The book
restages Dante’s epic journey through the circles of hell, limbo, and paradise
from a lesbian feminist perspective.

The program is scheduled for **Saturday, January 10, 2026, starting at 2:30pm**.
We estimate it will take about five hours to read the entire book.
