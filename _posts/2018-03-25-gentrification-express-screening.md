Please join us in Greenpoint for a screening of "Gentrification Express:
Breaking Down the BQX" and other short films around the history and
gentrification of North Brooklyn. Community conversation regarding the proposed
BQX streetcar to follow.

Screening order:

**"Don't Fall in Love with Buildings" Dir. Amy Jenkins, 8.5min, 2012**<br>
In the wake of rampant “luxury” development that doomed our Brooklyn
neighborhood, Don’t Fall in Love with Buildings was filmed with a surveillance
camera in time-lapse during the last five weeks of the eviction from our
Williamsburg, Brooklyn loft at 72 Berry Street, our home for over fifteen years.
The title comes from the anonymous graffiti spray-painted on our door in the
weeks before we vacated. Raw and unadorned, the physical and emotional process
of leaving one’s long-term home is poignantly revealed.

**"Gentrification Express: Breaking Down the BQX"**<br>
Dir. Samantha Farinella and Amanda Katz, 17min, 2017<br>
In January of 2016, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his plan for the
Brooklyn-Queens Connector (BQX), a streetcar that would run a 16-mile waterfront
route from Astoria, Queens to Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The announcement arrived
with a PR campaign that claims the BQX as a transit option that would, amongst
other things, serve the low-income communities along the corridor. A closer look
at who is pushing the plan and how it will be funded reveals that the BQX relies
on the displacement of the communities they are currently trying to sell it to.
