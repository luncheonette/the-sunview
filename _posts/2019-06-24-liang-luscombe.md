This meeting will take place on Monday June 24 at 7pm.

The Sunview Luncheonette<br>
221 Nassau Street, Brooklyn NY 11222

Liang Luscombe will present her work-in-progress single-channel video "Sweaty
Scales." This is a surreal comedy set in a world of brightly coloured
constructed film sets, puppets and sculptures. The video tells the story of a
pair of lovers: an Asian American woman named Lisa and her Caucasian lover
Oliver. Through this interracial romance, the project explores Lisa’s struggle
finding her own sexual identity and space for fantasy in relation to the bind
of representation that confronts Asian American women. Guided by a narrator
that performs upon a diamond-shaped staircase set, we follow Lisa and Oliver
through a world of parties, late-night cocktails, crafting evenings, and
film-going.

Liang Luscombe is a visual artist currently based in Chicago and undertaking
the 2018–2019 Chicago Artist Coalition’s HATCH residency. She has undertaken
residencies at the SOMA Summer, Mexico City, 2018; Australia Council Studio,
British School at Rome in 2013; and Perth Institute of Contemporary Art Studio
Residency, Perth in 2011. She was the recipient of an Australia Council JUMP
Mentorship in 2013 and was mentored by Australian painter Angela Brennan.
