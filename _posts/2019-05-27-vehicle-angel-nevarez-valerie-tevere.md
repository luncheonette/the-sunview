This meeting will take place on Monday May 27 at 7pm.

The Sunview Luncheonette<br>
221 Nassau Street, Brooklyn NY 11222

Angel Nevarez and Valerie Tevere will present their work-in-progress, "Toward a
New Anthem" which began with a trip to Baltimore where they researched
historical photographs and materials, and documented both the original
manuscript and the facsimile of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Maryland
Historical Society. In addition, they traveled both north and south across the
Francis Scott Key Bridge while listening to Jimi Hendrix's protest rendition of
the song (Francis Scott Key wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner", and as
commemoration the bridge was named after him).

"Toward a New Anthem" examines the political reverberations and manifested
responses to the "The Star-Spangled Banner" over the last century. Their larger
project will re-imagine and eventually (through collaborative songwriting)
re-write the lyrics and music of the national anthem.

In preparation for the conversation, Nevarez and Tevere suggest this reading:

Angel Nevarez and Valerie Tevere are multidisciplinary artists whose projects
and research investigate contemporary music and sound, the electromagnetic
spectrum, dissent, and public fora. Their interests lie in the intersection
between art, music, and civic action/responsibility, and historical moments
that resonate through distinct musical instrumentation and sonorous traditions.
