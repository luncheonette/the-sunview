Do you have a rumpled shirt stuffed in the corner of your closet with a hole that you've been putting off fixing? Now's your chance to bring it to the Sunview and enjoy some company and hot soup while you patch.

Repair Day at the Sunview this Sunday March 1st, 2-6ish. Needles, thread and soup provided!
