Film Screening

**Clotheslines, Dir. Roberta Cantow, 1981, 32mins**<br>
Cantow's remarkable Emmy award winning film Clotheslines is an enduring, vivid
account, showing how the creative energies of women have been sapped by mundane
tasks, and in turn how such tasks reflect a ritualistic approach to life.
Called "[an] experience that will be a revelation to both men and women," the
film documents the pragmatic, symbolic and artistic role of laundry in women's
lives.

**Girls and Boys, Dir. Tomasz Gubernat, 2016, 14mins**<br>
Girls and Boys is an observational portrait of a woman in Brooklyn, seemingly
alone in her struggle to teach a group of young students the basics of dancing
in the Polish Folk tradition. Girls and Boys is an intimate glimpse into the
interactions of adolescence and the sometimes comical challenges of the
teaching experience.
