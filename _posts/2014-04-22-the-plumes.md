<p>You've probably heard about "the plume" — the gigantic oil spill that lies under Greenpoint. But did you know there are other plumes of toxic chemicals pooled up beneath the ground here as well? Residues of recent industry and long-lost trades that now threaten our well-being, bubbling to the surface and in some cases entering into people's homes.</p>
<p>Where did they come from? Where are they going? Can we live beside/on top of them? How are we as residents affected? New York State is beginning to clean up the mess, but what exactly are they doing and how are they going about it?</p>
<p>Come to the Sunview Luncheonette, 221 Nassau Ave., Wed, April 30, 7 p.m., for an analysis of these questions and more, as a panel of informed folks gives an update on recent developments around the plumes of Greenpoint.</p>
<p>A presentation by Ryan Kuonen, and Mike Schade, with images and propositions by T. Willis Elkins.</p>
<p>To be followed by open discussion and plum(e) soup.</p>
