"Blue Plate Special" is a tribute to diners and coffeeshops - the communing over
food and a cup of coffee as part of everyday workaday life in the city. A
cornucopia of diner dreams presented by Broken Toys, a shadow play collaboration
between artists Stephanie Wuertz and Alice Cohen w/ rotating musical
accompaniment.<br>
Using primitive materials such as flashlights through cardboard cutouts and
found objects, Broken Toys is an improvisation based on spontaneous play.<br>
With sound by Dominika Mazurová and Shelley Hirsch.

Stephanie Wuertz: a NY based visual and curator working in film, drawing and
performance
