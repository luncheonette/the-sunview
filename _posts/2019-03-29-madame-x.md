### Madame X: An Absolute Ruler

*'Madame X - Eine absolute Herrscherin'* ~ Directed by Ulrike Ottinger

The notorious pirate ruler Madame X (played by actress / designer / muse Tabea
Blumenschein) places a print ad, calling on women to escape their boring lives
and promising "gold, love and adventure" to all who come aboard her ship, the
Orlando. A motley crew including a housewife, diva and artist (played by Yvonne
Rainer) embark on a quest for self-transformation, which quickly heads towards
destruction as they are subjected to Madame X's sadistic, erotic escapades.

### MADAME X: AN ABSOLUTE RULER

by Ulrike Ottinger<br>
In German with English subtitles, 1977, 141 min, 16mm / screening digitally @ Sunview

Madame X, a harsh, pitiless beauty, the cruel uncrowned ruler of the China Sea,
launches an appeal to all women willing to exchange their comfortable and
secure but unbearably dull lives for a world of dangers and uncertainties, free
from rules and patriarchal tyranny. A variety of women respond to her call, but
they soon find themselves swapping one kind of servitude for another, as Madame
X demands complete devotion from her shipmates, even the ones she is enamored
with. MADAME X transgresses traditional gender roles as well as traditional
modes of narrative cinema to create a challenging and allegorical tale of
gender liberation.
