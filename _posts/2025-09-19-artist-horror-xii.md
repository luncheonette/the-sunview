Friday, September 19, 7:00PM: ARTIST-HORROR XII: Mystery of the Wax Museum, 1933.
Ivan Igorâ€™s uncritical commitment to aesthetic realism leads him to body
snatching, murder and more. Animate/inanimate, Lionel Atwill, and the dilemma of
art and commerce, all in exciting two-strip Technicolor. Free pizza, free beer.
Hangouts at 7, film at 8.
