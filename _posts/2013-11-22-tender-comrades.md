<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I want to invite you (and anyone you think I forgot!) to a private-ish screening of my film Tender Comrades this Tuesday at one of my favorite spots in the city: The Sunview Luncheonette! We will gather in our cozy social club space (complete with booths and spinny counter stools!) for an intimate screening of this short (23 min) film starring Laryssa Husiak, Chris Giarmo, Yours Truly, and a significant eruption in NYC public discourse:</p>
<p>Shot partially at Occupy Wall Street, the film uses real-life events, fake interviews, and lo-fi re-enactments to illuminate a few anecdotes in the history of anarchism and subversive movements in the Americas. Following the screening the soup of opinion will be served with the ladle of love. Also, actual soup/stew to fill your bellies.</p>
<p>The details:<br />
Tuesday November 19th<br />
7:30 PM<br />
The Sunview Luncheonette</p>
<p>Please RSVP. It will help with stew-prep.</p>

Bio:
<a href="https://www.sunitaprasad.net/">Sunita Prasad</a> is a New York City-based artist. Her projects employ methods of visual translation such as drag, re-enactment, movement, and touch to shift or rupture expectations about how gendered bodies should behave, be represented, or be historicized. Her works have been shown in galleries, festivals, and performance venues internationally, including the Palais de Tokyo in Paris; the Brooklyn Museum, Flux Factory and Momenta Art in New York City; and Homesession in Barcelona. Sunita is originally from Syracuse NY and received a BFA in Film & TV from New York University and an MFA in Photography from the Rhode Island School of Design.
