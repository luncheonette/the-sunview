A night of guitar deconstruction featuring **Lyle Rivera, Gían Pérez, and
Celine Kang**. The three guitarists will each play solo sets and then in a
first time trio, exploring a vast spectrum of approach to the guitar.

Lyle Rivera existe en su mundo de gotas de lluvia.

Gían Pérez es un artista Boricua que le tiene alergia a la guitarra. Sigue
buscando como derretirse. Su disco ‘bambú’ esta disponible en todas las
plataformas.

Celine (Suh Yeon) Kang was born in Seoul, South Korea; where she started her
career as a guitarist, producer and a composer. Now studying at The New
School’s School of Jazz and Contemporary Music with Joe Morris, Darius Jones,
Steve Cardenas and more, she has been expanding her spectrum to jazz and
improvised music - as well as composing and releasing her own work.
