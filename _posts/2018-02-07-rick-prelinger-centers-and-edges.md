Please join us at Sunview Luncheonette for an evening with Rick Prelinger as he presents a montage of home and amateur movies from around North America, focusing on both its capitals and peripheries.

Visions and vantagepoints include footage of above average interest- the construction of Pruitt-Igoe projects in St Louis, with the workers drinking fancy booze at the construction company’s Christmas party; a Latino family partying in San Francisco; some roadtrip material from long ago; a truly demented cityscape reel shot by Detroiters who were either drunk or visionary, or maybe both; various flavors of love; bar patrons on Bunker Hill in LA at Christmas and New Year’s 1960; etc etc.

BYOB / Non-Members Please RSVP to hello@thesunview.org
