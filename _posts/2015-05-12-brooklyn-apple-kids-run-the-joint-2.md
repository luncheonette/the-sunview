Kids run the joint: students from the **Brooklyn Apple** return to Sunview to cook pizza, with vegetarian options. Adults will be present, but will endeavor to be largely invisible, letting the kids run the show as much as possible. Plan on arriving between 11:30-1. We'll be pushing you out the door around 1:30. If you'd like to get some work done on your lunch break, there is WI-FI available. **Note:** *We can only take 15 reservations for these events.*

**Email to RSVP:** Brooklynappleacademy@gmail.com

*Proceeds this month will benefit Nepal recovery efforts.*
