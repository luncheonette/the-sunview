Alejandro’s work has been published internationally in magazines such as Newsweek, Nowness, Domus, the Financial Times, View, the Guardian, le Monde, Stern, PDN, the New Yorker, the Independent, Monocle and Wallpaper among others.</p>
<p><strong>Max Pinckers</strong> grew up in Asia and then moved to his native Belgium. Pinckers‘ work is largely oriented around long-term subjective documentary projects presented as photobooks and installations such as <em>The Fourth Wall and Will They Sing Like Raindrops</em> or <em>Leave Me Thirsty</em>. His work has been exhibited internationally, including at Bozar - Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels; Fotomuseum, Antwerp; and Flanders Center, Osaka, among others. In 2015 Max Pinckers became a nominee member of <em>Magnum</em> Photos.</p>
<p><strong>Maciej Markowicz</strong> is a Polish artist who lives and works in Brooklyn. After a childhood spent in his grandfather’s painting studio and his father’s metal shop, Markowicz pursued photography, studying in London and New York. His work combines photography and design to explore the pictorial language of fine art with the intrinsically utilitarian orientation of graphic design. Markowicz is inspired by the basic principles of photography, its ability to draw light, and poetic immaterial impressions of place.</p>
