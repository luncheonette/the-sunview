We warmly invite you to join us for the third gathering of **Journaling as
Resistance**, a workshop series weaving together journaling and somatics practices
to explore internal accountability, decolonial repair, and global solidarity.

[STORM](https://stormbookstore.com/), a swana bookstore, has been home to this
workshop series. While its physical location has shifted, its spirit continues
to thrive, and we are grateful to find a new home at Sunview Luncheonette.

📖✨ **Journaling as Resistance #3** offers an expanded space to deepen our
voices, guided by the wisdom of Alexis Pauline Gumbs (*Undrowned*) and Audre
Lorde (*Uses of the Erotic*). Together, we will practice listening “beyond the
normative ability to hear,” reflecting collectively, and connecting with
body-centered practices that support us to “dare to be powerful.” We will
practice speaking our truths with integrity and vulnerability.

Through journaling prompts, somaticsexercises, and group reflection, we will
nurture self-reflection, resistance, and healing, held in togetherness.
