<blockquote><em>"Then he poured for us a beverage which he called 'Slum gullion,' and it is hard to think he was not inspired when he named it. It really pretended to be tea, but there was too much dish-rag, and sand, and old bacon-rind in it to deceive the intelligent traveler. ... We could not eat the bread or the meat, nor drink the 'slumgullion.'"</em> (Mark Twain, Roughing It, Chapter IV)</p></blockquote>
<p>Slumgullion: a get-together, featuring presentations by Dan Torop and Matthew Thurber on the measures of space and colorspace, the CIE, the ITC, The Pony Express and the Overland Stage, handwriting analysis, patents! The telegraph or the digital signal. Intelligence and vision.</p>
<p>We will read from U.S. Patent 3,971,065 (Bayer &amp; Eastman Kodak, "Color Imaging Array", 1976), "Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed Demosaicing Algorithm" (Hirakawa/Parks, 2005), and "Recommendation ITU-R BT.2020 (08/2012): Parameter values for ultra-high definition television systems for production and international programme exchange". We will drink slumgullion at every mention of the human observer.</p>
