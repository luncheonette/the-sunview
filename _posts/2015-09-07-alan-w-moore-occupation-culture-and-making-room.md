<p><strong>Alan W. Moore</strong> will come by the Sunview on September 18th at 7:30 PM to discuss his two new books, <i>“Occupation Culture: Art &amp; Squatting in the City from Below”</i> and <i>“Making Room: Making Room: Cultural Production in Occupied Spaces”</i>. Both of these books concern political squatting, mainly in Europe. Both are available in print and online as PDFs for free. <i>Occupation Culture</i> is the story of a journey through the world of recent political squatting in Europe, told by a veteran of the 1970s and ‘80s New York punk art scene. It is also a kind of scholar adventure story. Moore sees with the trained eye of a cultural historian, pointing out pasts, connections and futures in the creative direct action of today’s social movements.</p>
<p><i>Occupation Culture</i> is based on five years of travel and engaged research. It explicates the aims, ideals and gritty realities of squatting. Despite its stature as a leading social movement of the late twentieth century, squatting has only recently received scholarly attention. The rich histories of creative work that this movement enabled are almost entirely unknown.</p>
<p>Both these books come out of a long-term information project called “House Magic: Bureau of Foreign Correspondence.” The project is blogged at “Occupations and Properties.” Many of the contributors to the <i>Making Room</i> book are members of the SqEK research group on squatting in Europe, which held its conference in Barcelona in May of 2015. The <i>Making Room</i> anthology was presented there, with an exhibition which will be repeated in September at ABC No Rio in New York City.</p>
<p>Alan will be joined in conversation by <strong>Stephen Zacks</strong>, author of <em><a href="http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/3976-a-beautiful-ruin-the-generation-that-transformed-new-york-1967-1986">A Beautiful Ruin: The Generation that Transformed New York, 1967-1986.</a></em></p>
