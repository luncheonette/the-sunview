__BEING MADE A STRANGER__<br>
__Which is the tragedy?__<br>
__Choey__

Like a layover on her constant travels, for 12 hours on Saturday, July 2, Choey
will illuminate the interior of the Sunview Luncheonette with LED drawings made
at her recent residency with MASS MoCA. Each piece begins with a contour
drawing—wherein sensation precedes perception, and the focus is the outcome
rather than interpretation—and then is transformed into LED pieces by hand
using partially ready-made materials. The result is somewhere between
representation and abstraction, and just one more part of Choey’s larger
project of expanding the processes of signification. Of this particular sign,
Choey writes:

_"Why banana?  Why NOT a banana? Once I tell a story of my banana, my fixation
and wonderment to banana being a derogatory for Asian American (yellow on the
outside and white on the inside), the work will be ruined because these bananas
should be a stranger to a reader, not a fixed notion, not a thing with
meaning."_

Always a traveler and never a tourist, Choey will install her drawings in the
Luncheonette in a manner that both highlights the unavoidable
"site-specificity" of the diner, without forcing connection to its unique
history.

Choey is a visual artist from S. Korea. She was born in South Korea, grew up in
Saipan, CNMI and nurtured in the US. She has a complicated relationship to her
learned languages and cultures and is constantly curious about her relationship
to her languages. The central framework of her practice is inseparable to
translation theory; thus, she works as a language trainer and a part-time
translator. Choey is currently based in the US and South Korea.
