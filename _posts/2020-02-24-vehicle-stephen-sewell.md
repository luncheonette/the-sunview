"Three Lessons (How to shoot a gun)" is an essay film that examines the
reproduction and naturalization of gun culture by following a young woman as
she travels across the United States to learn how to operate a firearm from
three men of different backgrounds and ideological points of view. The video
forestalls discussion of the Second Amendment in favor of examining gun culture
in relation to history, identity/identification, and the reproduction of
ideologies. The montage of instructional footage, interviews of the
participants discussing their history and experiences with firearms, found
footage, and animation underscores the gaps and contradictions that arise
between individual experiences and uses these dissonances to identify the
underlying political, economic and social forces shaping them. As the video
shifts between these individual experiences and larger determining forces the
realization that these customs of gun ownership are not given but historically
practiced becomes apparent and the capacity for change more evident.
