You are cordially invited to an evening of ranting and raving, in poster-making
form.

The world is in tangles and we all need different ways of speaking our minds.
Don't forget, NYC is the original internet and together, we are going to make a
post...

Come with rants and raves and we will help you make them into real posters. No
skills required, only thoughts and feelings.

Paper, printer/copier and some supplies provided - bring anything else you want
to make images with.
