Join us at The Sunview Luncheonette in Greenpoint on Friday the 4th November at
7pm for the New York premiere of Liang Luscombe’s new short film, the science
fiction extravaganza Malamadre (2022).

Taken from the Spanish word for the ‘bad mother’ spider plant, Malamadre is the
latest work in Liang Luscombe’s ongoing surreal comedy series that follows Sol
and Fran on their intergalactic odyssey away from the financial horrors of
Earth and towards the planet Howl. Opening with a sickly Fran and a hangry
alien puppet Alice, the film immediately casts doubt on the promise of Howl as
a utopia. What Fran finds instead is a strange matriarchal world of asexual
reproduction where mothers feed on their young. Will Fran reckon with her
maternal fears and finally enjoy a symbiotic alien relationship? Moreover, will
she make use of the planet’s five hundred beaches before they close at 5pm?

To set the stage for Malamadre, the evening will begin with two short films
that also circle on the theme of the monstrous mother and the femme body as a
site of complex meaning: Claire Lambe’s I Think I’m turning into a Monster
(2021) and Ilana Harris-Babou’s Decision Fatigue (2020).

Dinner will be served.
