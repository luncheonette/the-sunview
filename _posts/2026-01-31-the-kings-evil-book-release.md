#### About the Book
A contemporary fairy tale about the inextricable relationship of good and evil,
_The King's Evil_ begins with the narrator's formative visit to a Mondrian
retrospective and goes on to narrate his meeting, later in life, with a
precocious, increasingly dangerous orphan who appears out of an endless pine
forest.

> “Will Heinrich has written a dark fable about the boundaries of humanity. Set in a world not quite our own. The King’s Evil is an uncompromising story of two characters locked in a life-and-death struggle over the everyday minutiae of existence. Heinrich deftly examines the roots of power, evil, and love―the things that make us human, the things that separate us from inhumanity.”

―Adrian McKinty

> “A thriller, a fairy tale, a love story, a treatise on art and disease―this small book, somehow, becomes all of these. This is a book you will pick up and read through the night like you did as a child.”

―Andrew Sean Greer
