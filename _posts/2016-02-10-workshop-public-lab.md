<p>Join for experiments in collecting oil sheens and identifying where they came from, led by artist and Sunview member <a href="http://vakula.eu">Matej Vakula</a>, who writes:</p>
<p>"<a href="https://publiclab.org/">Public Lab</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.newtowncreekalliance.org/">Newtown Creek Alliance</a> and Sunview Luncheonette, is organizing an oil sheen collection and analysis workshop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn - site of the second largest (but not widely known) oil spill in US history! We will be testing new methods PL is developing for oil collection and extraction.  We will be using our Oil Testing Kit for sample analysis, and the PL Spectrometer. We’ll collect samples from Newtown Creek superfund site and adjacent areas. We will learn how extract oil residues and analyse collected samples.</p>
<p>Limited space. RSVP here: <a href="https://publiclab.org/notes/Matej/02-04-2016/public-lab-workshop-at-the-subview-luncheonette">https://publiclab.org/notes/Matej/02-04-2016/public-lab-workshop-at-the-subview-luncheonette</a></p>
<p>We're hoping to use our own prototype fluorescence method for distinguishing oils on a few samples which have already been lab analyzed, to see if our tests correlate with official results.</p>
<p>The event will take place on <strong>Saturday, February 13th, </strong>2pm<strong> - </strong>6pm at the social club Sunview Luncheonette, 221 Nassau Ave. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. (Next to McGolrick Park)</p>
<p>Friday sample collection meeting TBD, Saturday sample collection meeting 10:30am N Henry Street &amp; Greenpoint Ave.</p>
<p>[note] please stay tuned for updates about the locations</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM:</strong><br />
The Day before AND the morning of the event we’ll collect and document collection of oil sheen from some specific site where it's been measured before by a lab extract oil residue from samples</p>
<p>Compare reference samples and official test results (spectroscopy) from Randy, try isopropyl extraction</p>
<p>Further test LED cuvette frame test new coastguard oils sheen collection net, the freezing method and PIG Oil Only absorbent mat pads."</p>
