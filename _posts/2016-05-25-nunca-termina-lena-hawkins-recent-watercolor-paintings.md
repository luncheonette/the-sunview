<p><strong>Lena Hawkins’</strong> visual work draws upon ritual and occult imagery, exploring constructed realities, otherness, and death through painting, performance and tattooing. A majority of the works showing May 28th were painted while traveling in Peru in January 2016. Hawkins visited the San Martin region of the Amazon where she participated in an ayahuasca ceremony with a curandero. Works are painted with a mix of gouache and natural pigments made in Peru including turmeric and coca seed.</p>
