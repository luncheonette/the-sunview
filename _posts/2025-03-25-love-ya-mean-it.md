- Come by at **7:30**.
- The very special, very Long Island screenings will start at **8:30**. (These
include uncovered gems from **Dylan Pettengill** and new work-in-progress gems
from **Hannah Gross**, and a brilliant, maniacal **David Wojnarowicz** film from
*1985). 
- Live music from the great Marija Kovecevic at **9:30**.

We'll have dinner - stew, salad, birthday cake - but please BYOB or BYOwine or whatever you'd like to drink.
