<p>Works by Sunview member Sunita Prasad. A culmination of a residency at T.A.J. &amp; SKE Projects in Bangalore, India this past spring. <em>Recitations not from memory </em>is an installation of video works on gendered experience in urban, middle-class India. Women's stories of discrimination are re-mapped onto men's performances in an introspective translation of experience. The <em>Recitations</em> will be installed on monitors in the diner booths throughout the space for leisurely individual viewing. Another piece on view is <em>Agni Agonies</em>, a projected clip reel of Indian women surviving fires in Bollywood (and some Hollywood) cinema. With some minor interventions.</p>
<p>This project was made possible through the generous support of the Art Matters Foundation, the Brooklyn Arts Council, the Madagascar Institute, Angela Conant, and Ingrid Staats.</p>
