'Titanic' from 1953

Directed by Jean Negulesco. With Clifton Webb, Barbara Stanwyck, Robert Wagner,
Audrey Dalton.
Dawn made several works - impressively obsessive pen-and-ink re-creations of
movie interiors set aboard the Titanic, notably 'Smoking Room'  and 'Dinning
Room' which were shown in 'Storylines' at the Snug Harbor Museum in 2007. —-

A screening and presentation by Claudia Bitran
Titanic -A Deep Emotion (2014-2019) is Claudia Bitran's ongoing shot of shot
reinterpretation of Titanic (1997). It is an experimental film that collages
and weaves live action, animation and sound pieces, created during shoots and
performances in 20 cities across the United Stated, Chile and Mexico. The
production counts with the participation of 550+ actors: Bitran's friends,
family members, and volunteers that she recruits in public spaces.
