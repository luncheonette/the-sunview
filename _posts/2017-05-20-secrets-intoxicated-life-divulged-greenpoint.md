Brooklyn, NY – May 20, 2017 – The Sunview Luncheonette (221 Nassau Ave. Brooklyn),
a converted diner turned artist collective in Greenpoint, will host ***In Vino Veritas*: Secrets of the Intoxicated Life**,
a short film festival exploring how getting wasted can elevate the spirit,
enhance our creativity, make us wiser, deliver us onto freedom or otherwise improve the human condition.
Many formats - documentary, experimental, animation, and narrative film – will
be represented in the program, which is currently accepting submissions on
withoutabox and filmfreeway. In addition to Wengrofsky’s film on the World/Inferno
Friendship society, the program already includes a music video by Dutch musician
Truus De Groot and an excerpt from a *tableaux vivant* by acclaimed photographer
Sarah Small. In addition to cinematic pleasure, a paltry ten dollars will grant
unlimited whiskey or vodka drinks (while supplies last) – to put everyone in the
mood between films. Accepted films will be 5 to 10 minutes in duration. New York
City native Jeffrey Wengrofsky will host the festival. "With so many of my
friends embracing sobriety, I thought I'd brush against the grain with an event
that staggers over to the positive things associated with altered consciousness
– spiritual exploration, creativity, liberation of the ego, and the fun of
relinquishing self-control." This is the fourth film program in Wengrofsky’s
**Secrets** series. The Secrets series debuted at the Sunview in June 20i4 with
**Secrets of the Deep: Dreams on Film**, a program with five participating directors
and continued in June 2015 with **Secrets of the Insect World,** a program at
the Gene Frankel Theatre (NYC) featuring nine directors (and is heading to The
Lookout in Washington, DC in February). Secrets of the Heart followed in 2016.
The **Secrets** series is dedicated to the notion that there are some forms of
knowledge best encountered indirectly through the camera’s all seeing eye.
Event Info: **The Sunview Luncheonette** (221 Nassau Ave. Greenpoint, Bk) will
host ***In Vino Veritas*: Secrets of the Intoxicated Life** on Saturday,
**May 20th**, from 8pm til 11pm. **Ten dollars** and a 21+ ID at the door will
get you ten films and unlimited whiskey and vodka (while supplies last).
Curator/Host: Writer, director, and actor **Jeffrey Wengrofsky** is the fourth
generation of his family to make a home in NYC’s Lower East Side.  His films
have been screened at DOC NYC, Boston LGBT Film Festival, Berkeley Video and Film
Festival, Brownfish Film Festival (Cinema Village), Beacon Independent Film Festival,
Microscope Gallery, Churner &amp; Churner (NYC), and elsewhere. In 2015, he had
a residency at the UnionDocs Center for Documentary Art (Brooklyn) to work on
*The Song of Hiawatha*, his first feature-length film. In 2016, Wengrofsky had
a three-part residency at the Howl! Happening, an art space dedicated to the
artistic legacy of the Lower East Side. On August 11, 2017, Wengrofsky will have
a solo screening of his films at the Framestore Premiere Theatre in London.
