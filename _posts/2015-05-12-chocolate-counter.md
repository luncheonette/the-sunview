"Chocolate Counter" sees the artist **Whitney Vangrin** incorporating molten chocolate in an ode to a 1971 performance by the artist Gina Pane. In the original piece Pane plunged her hands into boiling chocolate attempting to confront people's indifference to the death of a young drug addict as well as their impulse to forget. Chocolate Counter seeks to confront the same indifference and abhorrence to bodies in pain and bodies of difference as it is manifested itself today.
