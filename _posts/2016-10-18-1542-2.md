<p>Saturday, October 22, 2016<br />
7:00 —  Searching for the vanishing points; free beer; some nude and some richly clothed; the apocalypse unveiled and a fight with death and slander<br />
8:00 —  Pasta alla Gricia (for the omnivorous, contains guanciale); plants withouts animals; rum cake à la Nordine; Saint Demetria guest appearance<br />
10:00 — <a href="https://bunwinkies.bandcamp.com/">Bunwinkies</a> —&gt; <a href="https://grasspath.bandcamp.com/releases">Grasspath</a><br />
11:00 — Erøs Archive; a train running through and around mountains; horrible birds of so many kinds; sincere promises; 🂡🂱🃁🃑🃟; 🀱🁣🀱…<br />
I can’t wait to see you, I miss you. This will be the best night of all of the nights.</p>
