Please come to the luncheonette this Friday, January 16, at 7:00 PM for
ARTIST-HORROR XVI: "The Cemetery," 1969. An artist-for-hire creates a painting
that drives a man to his death. Like “The Mezzotint” by M.R. James, but with
Roddy McDowell vs. Ossie Davis. Artwork-horror and animate/inanimate in this
segment from the pilot for Night Gallery. Will be chilly, wear warm layers. Film
is only 30 min. though. The show must go on. Free pizza, free beer. Hangouts at
7:00, film at 8:00.
