<p><b>The Voice's Folds</b></p>
<p>The Voice's Folds is a one night screening program with selected works by <strong>Morehshin Allahyari</strong>,<strong> Michael A. Morris</strong>, and <strong>Jenny Vogel</strong>. Made in a range of media from 16mm and 8mm film to 3D animation and streaming webcams, the works shift in voice between the personal and the social, the elegiac and the epistolary.</p>
<p>The films and videos in this program consider the voice--the first technology of intercession between individuals, the amplifier of the languages that frame us, the mode of address by which an author locates herself in relation to a reader. It is the filter through which histories are inscribed. Its folds move the air between us. It is the source of both the personal lyric and the collective chant, a connective tissue and a gulf between distant locations, resonating between Tehran and Texas, echoing in the constantly growing virtual deserts just beyond our screens.</p>
<p>“The voice, the voice, the voice, only the voice<br />
the voice of the tall yearning of plants to grow<br />
the voice of the transparent wish of water to flow<br />
the voice of starlight pouring<br />
on the surface of the pistil of the earth<br />
the voice of conception of the seed of meaning<br />
and expansion of love’s common mind<br />
The voice , the voice, the voice<br />
it is only the voice that remains.” -- Forough Farrokhzad</p>
