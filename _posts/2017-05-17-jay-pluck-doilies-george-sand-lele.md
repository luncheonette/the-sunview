The Doilies. They've only had one show so far, so I can't really say much about them.

This is George Sand, though: [https://georgesand.bandcamp.com/](https://georgesand.bandcamp.com/)

and this is Lele: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AiiZrcay2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AiiZrcay2A)

The night also includes Whitney Platt &amp; Nickolaus Typaldos and a reading by Ed Askew.

Things should get going at around 8pm, so please try to come.
