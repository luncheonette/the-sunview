Please come to the luncheonette this Saturday, February 28, for ARTIST-HORROR
XVII: _The Devil's Ticket_ (1961). Struggling painter Hector Vane sells his soul
in exchange for art world success, but must complete a portrait of another
person's soul within ninety days to complete the deal. _Can he do it?_ Let us
see on Saturday. The first in a series of artist horror films from the stellar
1960-62 television series _Thriller_, with your host Boris Karloff. Artistic
melancholy, Romantic myth, and of course Satan. Free pizza, free beer. Hangouts
at 7, film at 8.
