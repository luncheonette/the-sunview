Dear Friends,<br />
Please join us at the Sunview Luncheonette on Friday, December 9 at 8pm for a screening of **A.L. Steiner**'s *More Real Than Reality Itself*, with the artist in person, and an appearance by **Laurie Weeks**.

**Description from the 2014 Whitney Biennial:** A.L. Steiner's film *More Real Than Reality Itself* expands the structures of documentary film while challenging its conventional reliance on linear narratives. This critique takes shape through Steiner's reconsideration of the history of political activism and its representations—configuring a story that emphasizes the embodied, romantic aspects of activism rather than a singular, dominant history. Moving outward from Steiner’s family histories, the project traces the biographies of other individuals involved in social justice and the environmental and labor movements to offer a complex document of the long, continuing trajectory of activism.

Featuring Rita 'Bo' Brown, Carla Cloer, Ericka Huggins, Miya Masaoka and Laurie Weeks

Event is free, dinner will be served, please bring drinks for yourself and/or to share. Sunview Luncheonette: 221 Nassau Avenue, Brooklyn,  NY 11222

**Note: we've stopped taking RSVPs as the event is at capacity!**

Thanks and see you soon.
