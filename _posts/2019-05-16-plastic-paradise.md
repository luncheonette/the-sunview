Celebrate the joys of the boardwalk at the Sunview Luncheonette with a new
music video by Muller/Millar shot in Wildwood, N.J. featuring Alice Cohen and
the Ch.14 Weather Team. "Plastic Paradise" is a song from the upcoming LP
"Artificial Fairytales" on NNA Tapes. Afterwards, we will show "Night Tide"
directed by Curtis Harrington, starring Dennis Hopper and Marjorie Cameron.
Boardwalk food will be served. Wear your sailor hat.
