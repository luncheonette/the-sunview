Come by the luncheonette this Saturday, December 17, at 7:00 for the seventh
screening in our Real Estate Horror series, *Of Unknown Origin* from 1983. I am
super excited that Cosmo Bjorkenheim, who suggested the film, will co-host the
event as well. An investment banker in New York City is unable to protect his
recently purchased building from a particularly monstrous member of our
omnipresent rat population. Gut renovation, mortgage payments, and yuppie
horror all rolled into one, or as Cosmo says, "It's as if Cronenberg had
directed *The Money Pit*." Hangouts at 7, film at 8. Free pizza, free beer.
