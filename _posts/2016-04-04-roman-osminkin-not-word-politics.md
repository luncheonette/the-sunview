<p>We’re excited to announce the upcoming release of Roman Osminkin’s first English language collection of poems and songs entitled “Not A Word About Politics!” published by NYC-based <a href="http://www.cicadapress.net/">Cicada Press.</a></p>
<p><strong>Roman Osminkin (</strong>b.1979) is a Saint Petersburg based poet, artist, and performer.  Osminkin belongs to a community of Russian leftist artists, writers, activists, and intellectuals. He shares his comrades’ belief that creative work must be linked to activism and the building of oppositional community. He was a member of the Laboratory of Poetic Actionism, which combined video-poems (distributing the poetic word in three dimensions) and more aggressive interventions into public space. He was active in the Saint Petersburg Street University movement that emerged in 2008. He is a regular contributor to <em>Translit, </em>the most influential leftist journal of poetry and poetics in Russia.</p>
<p>He frequently collaborates with Chto Delat group and other artistic collectives.  His musical project Texno-Poetry performs regularly at festivals and art openings, often alongside Kirill Medvedev Arkady Kots band. He is a member of Russian Socialist Movement and a Ph.D student at the Russian Institute of Art History, writing a dissertation on participatory art and its popular manifestations beyond the art world.<br />
He has three books in Russian <em>Comrade-Thing </em>(Kraft, 2010), <em>Comrade-Word </em>(Kraft, 2012), and <em>Texts with External Objectives </em>(NLO, 2015)<em>.</em>  <em> </em>   <em><br />
</em><br />
<em>Not a Word About Politics! </em>(Cicada Press, NY, 2016) is Roman Osminkin’s first bi-lingual English-Russian publication, and a compendium of all existing English translation of his writing to-date.<br />
The book will be of interest to those interested in contemporary Russian protest poetry and art.<br />

<p>REVOLUTION<br />
Consider the aforementioned word<br />
Really think about it<br />
How did it appear on that screen/page/other surface (hereinafter, medium)?<br />
Turn the medium 180 degrees<br />
uoıʇnloʌǝɹ<br />
Look at the word again<br />
Stand on your head<br />
(If in your current physical state this is impossible just turn the medium another 180 degrees)<br />
Pronounce the word to yourself one syllable at a time<br />
Repeat the word in a barely audible whisper<br />
Pronounce the word aloud at the top of your voice<br />
Glance to both sides<br />
Smell the medium the word’s written on<br />
Think what you could compare the smell to<br />
Lick the medium the word’s written on<br />
Think what you could compare the taste to<br />
Pronounce the word again at your usual speaking volume<br />
And again<br />
And again<br />
Take a look around you<br />
If no one’s around pronounce the word at twice your usual speaking volume<br />
Glance to both sides<br />
If no one’s around shriek the word as loud as you possibly can<br />
Draw it out<br />
With a transition into a squeal on the last syllable,<br />
<em>oooooon </em>becoming <em>IIIIIIII</em><br />
Let your body join the scream<br />
Set your emotions free<br />
At this stage you should be joined by others<br />
At least one of your neighbors or coworkers<br />
If no one’s around then open all the windows and scream out each of them in order<br />
If that doesn’t work go outside<br />
Draw it out as long as you possibly can<br />
Shout the word out<br />
Don’t be shy<br />
Walk proud through the middle of traffic singing it<br />
Someone will join you here<br />
Coordinate your actions and sing in unison<br />
Don’t stop<br />
In time your song has to become a resounding chant<br />
Just ignore the disgruntled motorists honking their horns and the cop who’s right behind you with a grip on your sleeve fixing to hit you with a billyclub<br />
Give yourself completely over to what you’re doing – sing chant dance<br />
Kick everything else out of your path<br />
Now if you’re really following these instructions<br />
At some point you’re going to have to set the controls for the Kremlin<br />
Go there<br />
Gather the last of your strength<br />
Take a deep breath<br />
And together shout the word as loud as you possibly can one last time<br />
If the decibel level gets high enough, the Kremlin will have no choice but to beautifully reveal itself as a house of cards and collapse into a thousand red bricks<br />
Gather them. They’re magical stones, and you need them for the next level<br />
Congratulations! You have arrived at the end of the national level and will receive a bonus credit in the form of one extra life<br />
While the next level’s loading, try to relax. Listen to the Internationale.<br />
OK, the next level’s loaded<br />
It’s a global level called<br />
WORLD REVOLUTION<br />
Consider the aforementioned word<br />
Really think about it<br />
