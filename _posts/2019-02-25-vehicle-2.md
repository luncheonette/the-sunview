Vehicle is a monthly meeting where a group of artists and other interested
practitioners get together, drink, munch, and have candid conversations about
the work they produce.

This meeting will take place on Monday February 25 at 7pm.

The Sunview Luncheonette<br>
221 Nassau Street, Brooklyn NY 11222

Autumn Knight will present her work-in-progress, "Pong." This single-channel
video focusses on a woman darting back and forth across an empty space. This
meditative study of a singular figure works to decipher an internal landscape,
determine a trustworthy timeline for the intersection of artist and subject,
while also redirecting a particular type of gaze.

In preparation for the conversation, Autumn Knight suggests this reading:
