William Powell, author of *The Anarchist Cookbook (1971)* said it was initially
designed as a book meant to provide education towards "the silent majority"
of the American population. He described that the book was not intended for
extant political fringe organizations, rather it was designed to galvanize a
great societal change by inciting the general population. It contains
‘recipes’ for the manufacture of explosives, rudimentary telecommunications
phreaking devices, and related weapons, as well as instructions for home
manufacturing of illicit drugs, including LSD.

*The Animist Cookbook (2019)* is an exhibition and a manual for recognizing
that the silent, inanimate things around us, seemingly non-sentient, are in
flux and can act and react with their own agency. Our surroundings and the
things we are surrounded by are not necessarily passive, they exert influence
on how we behave. The space around us, and its ambient conditions, respond to
our presence and actions in ways that can be made more apparent through our
interventions. The work presented illuminates a path to decenter ourselves
and empathize with our environment.

The Animist Cookbook will have its first incarnation at the Sunview
Luncheonette. A day and evening  of actions, gestures, interactions,
interventions with the space (inside/out) and the things that reside there.
The Luncheonette appears more as a site of everyday life  rather than the
antiseptic space typical of galleries and museums. The accumulated history
embedded in its materiality will provide a point of departure.

**About the Artists:**

**Jace Clayton** is an artist and writer based in Manhattan, also known for
his work as DJ /rupture. Clayton uses an interdisciplinary approach to focus
on how sound, memory, and public space interact, with an emphasis on
low-income communities and the global South. His book Uproot: Travels in 21st
Century Music and Digital Culture was published in 2016 by Farrar, Straus and
Giroux. He serves on the Music faculty of Bard College’s Milton Avery
Graduate School of the Arts and is currently teaching a seminar on
‘Interdisciplinary Temporalities in Performance’ at Harvard University.

A rigorous conceptual framework grounds Clayton as he move across areas as
diverse as software design, composition of choral works, or turntablism. As
so many of our ways of communicating with each other and experiencing the
world translate to the digital and dematerialize, he reflects on what is
lost, what new possibilities emerge, and contemporary art’s role in
contouring these changes. These considerations inform his work, which often
draws on populist modes of expression in combination with a critical approach
to technology.

**Angela Dufresne** is a painter and video artist originally from Connecticut.
She was raised in Olathe, Kansas, the town Dick and Perry stopped in before
they killed the Clutters (In Cold Blood). She lives and works in Brooklyn, NY
and sometimes can be found in the Catskills. She received the first college
degree in her family lineage. Her work articulates non-paranoid, porous ways of
being in a world fraught by fear, power and possession. Through painting,
drawing and performative works, she wields heterotopic narratives that are
non-hierarchical, joyous and polymorphous.  She has exhibited at the Hammer
Museum in Los Angeles; P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens, NY; the
Portland Museumof Art in Portland, ME; The National Academy of Arts and Letters
in New York;The Leslie-Lohman Museum in New York; the Kemper Museum in Kansas

**Thomas Kovachevich**<br>
Born in Detroit, Michigan, New York based artist Thomas Kovachevich began
making artworks in Chicago in the 1960s. Kovachevich’s practice explores a
variety of mediums; his close observation of ordinary (and un-ordinary)
materials has lead to the development of an extraordinarily diverse body of
works, including painting, that liken to a visual diary derived from direct
observations, imagined sightings and emotional states of mind, sculpture made
from string and tissue to wood to glass to plastic, and performance that is a
unique visual extraordinaire. Kovachevich’s work has been seen in galleries and
museums in Europe, Asia and the US. along with solo exhibitions at
international art fairs: Nada New York, Nada Miami, Frieze New York, Chicago
Art Fair, Verona Art Fair, Verona, IT. Museum solo exhibitions include: Museum

Vielle Charite, Marseille, FR, Baviera Museum, Zurich, CH

**Nitin Mukul** (born in Lawrence, Massachusetts) is a visual artist based in
Queens, NYC. His practice lead him to bridge video and painting, arriving at a
new format for experiencing a painting as a durational event. He named the
process ‘durational painting’. These works begin by layering paint in sheets of
ice, freezing each layer of media so that they accumulate layers of color and
texture. Placing the frozen mass outside or in a room, he allows it to melt
according to natural weather conditions, filming the process with a tight zoom.
This series continues to evolve: as instruments reflecting ambient conditions
of the site they are made in: light, temperature, time of day, location, our
climate at large, historic resonance, and as a new context for understanding
the practice of abstract painting that calls for deep viewing and appreciating
the potential of materials used to act with their own agency. He recently
lectured about his work at RISD, and presented new work at the ICA
Philadelphia. In 2020 he will be an Artist In Residence at the Caldera Arts
Center in Sisters, Oregon. In 2019 he completed video installations at Pioneer
Works, Brooklyn and Lincoln Center, NYC, and exhibits with Aicon Gallery, NYC.
