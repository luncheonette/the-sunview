Comrades! On Friday, September 27, at 7:00, you must come to: **ARTIST-HORROR
VII: Color Me Blood Red, 1965**. Adam Sorg achieves art world success by
murdering people and painting with their blood. No-budget schlock from the
Godfather of Gore, Herschell Gordon Lewis. Like *Bucket of Blood*, but worse.
Free pizza, free beer. Hangouts at 7, film at 8.
