A master on a self-built 23 string banjo, Paul Metzger's Idiosyncratic & deeply
original long form improvisations can bring to mind American primitive guitar,
the sarod of Hindustani music, or the Chinese Erhu. But fundamentally his music
grows from a deep commitment to exploring every possible expressive sound that
can be extracted from his instrument. His 'home-made' aesthetic has drawn
comparisons to DIY mavericks like Charlie Nothing or Eugene Chadbourne with his
electric rake, but the depth of Metzger's explorations led David Keenan to
assert in The Wire magazine that Metzger "reveal(s) the true meaning of
virtuosity." A key voice in the world of avant-garde & experimental folk, he
creates a music evocative of some magical forgotten age, but is simultaneously
deeply rooted in the eternal present when fingers touch strings.

*"...Metzger’s banjo and guitar contain multitudes. Suspended between past and
future, honouring the tradition while hijacking it, listening for its voice
while revelling in its inarticulacies; this is how the thing sings. And the
song, in the obsessive extensions of Metzger’s instruments, truly has no
ending."* - The Wire

Guitarist, thereminist, singer, and player of some species of dismantled
electrified folk, John Saint Pelvyn is a musical enigma of the best kind. At
the root of his playing is something akin to traditional stride, but rich with
quivering whammy bar wobble and shimmering feedback. He often plays the tailfin
strings of his archtop like one would play harmonics, or retunes seamlessly
mid-stream to create a shifting temperament across the length of a piece. An
affinity for the likes of John Fahey and Loren Mazzacane-Connors can be heard
here, but the comparisons quickly fall away as one takes in this ambidextrous
musical sensibility. He will sing otherworldly vocal duets with his theremin
while simultaneously accompanying himself fingerpicking, or will throw
modulated feedback tones across otherwise inviting harmonic landscapes based
on blues & folk motifs, overshadowing them with clouds of squelch that loom
like an approaching post-noise squall, but that ultimately swell and
punctuate more like the tone clusters of Henry Cowell or the lyrical
saxophone of Frank Lowe.

*"When wandering the stage singing into the F-holes of his electric arch top
bringing forth arpeggios of feedback, or waving the neck of his guitar in the
vicinity of a howling theremin, indeed, he seems to be playing the very air
itself."* - Electro Motive Records
