_velak_ is a series organising concerts and performances with the focus around
electronic, experimental and improvised music. The concert series hosts local
and international acts and takes a normadic form of organisation playing in
different settings and spaces around Vienna / Austria, but also has
collaborated with other organisers from abroad to play _velak-export_ events.
There will be different sets by part of the velak group and friends from New
York during those days at The Sunview Luncheonette.
