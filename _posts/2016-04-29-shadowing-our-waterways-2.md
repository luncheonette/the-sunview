<p><strong>SHADOWING OUR WATERWAYS</strong></p>
<p>Saturday, May 7, 1 - 3:30 PM</p>
<p><em>Puppet-storytelling between Brooklyn and Cairo.</em></p>
<p>Come help Shadowing Our Waterways tell stories about our Newtown Creek puppets! We’ve made puppets based on our research into Newtown Creek, and for our last Greenpoint workshop, we’ll be collaging text to write the life stories of our characters. Help us transform ominous superfund reports into lively tales. This project will be exhibited at an open studio night at the Old Stone House in September. This event is free, all materials included. Drop-ins are welcome, RSVP suggested to Alexandra.zevin@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Shadowing Our Waterways is an intercultural project facilitated by But a Shadow of Myself, made possible with public funds from the Decentralization Program of the New York State Council on the Arts, administered in Kings County by Brooklyn Arts Council.</p>
