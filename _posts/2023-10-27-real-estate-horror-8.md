Please come by the luncheonette this Friday, October 27, for Real Estate
Horror VIII: Homebodies. The tagline of this 1974 film pretty much says
it all: “A murder a day keeps the landlord away!” A group of elderly
tenants band together to save their building from real estate developers.
With murder. We’ll be celebrating Bea’s Name Day (October 26) as well.
Free pizza, free beer. Hangouts at 7, movie at 8.
