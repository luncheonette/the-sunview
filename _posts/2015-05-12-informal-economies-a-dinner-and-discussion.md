<p><em>Informal economy: any exchange of goods or services that is unwaged and unregulated (babysitting, landscaping, street vendors, etc)</em>Join us for a dinner and discussion of informal economies.</p>
<p>Interactions of labor, wages, art and value are made implicit in most exchanges, yet these interactions are increasingly being made explicit, are re-presented, used as artistic mediums, and explored across disciplines. We’ll discuss how these economic structures tie into social reproduction, what time-banking is, interning, volunteering, bartering and sharing — all while we enjoy a delicious meal made with produce from the 607CSA.</p>
