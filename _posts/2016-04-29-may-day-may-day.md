<p>Come celebrate May Day in peace by not paying for brunch.  Emily G will be making a big slew of pancakes and coffee to share by donation only. Pay what you can! Bring what you like!  If you want we can talk about the Haymarket Affair of 1886, police brutality, the struggle for workers rights, and how our political landscape used to have more prominent players at the turn of the 20th century than we do at the turn of the 21st.</p>
