Come by the luncheonette on Friday, September 13, for the fourth installment of
Real Estate Horror: *Candyman* (1992), directed by Bernard Rose, and structured
around the spatial juxtaposition of the Cabrini-Green housing projects,
occupied by working-class African Americans, and the Gold Coast-adjacent
condominium of the white protagonist. Hangouts at 7, film at 8.
