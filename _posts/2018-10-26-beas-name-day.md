> The details accrue to paint a picture of a woman refining her craft, where
> that craft is the running of a small, community diner for the express benefit
> of neighbors. Like the "Living National Treasures" of Japan (literal name:
> Preservers of Intangible Cultural Properties), Bea plied this craft all but in
> defiance of a world that would have it slicked up, sold out, and repeated.
> Surely, as the neighborhood began down its fateful path towards manic
> real-estate bubbles and hurricane-force gentrification, the pressures on Bea's
> space to change would have been powerful.
