<p>Hi Friends–</p>
<p>Join us at //Sunview\\, for a dialogue on recognizing our common areas of need and concern as a means for collaboration and the creation of social spaces.</p>
<p>Togetherness, empathy, trust, respect, &amp; care – how can the turning of our attention to these underlying purposes of far-ranging practices such as urban farming, DIY, social art practice, community organizing, utopian visioning, and healing be a means and thrust for upscaling social change?</p>
<p>We will present global examples of creative spaces and discuss the dynamics from which spaces for change are created and sustained. Dylan and other members of the Sunview Luncheonette will speak briefly about the history of the space, while touching on Greenpoint's legacy of environmental activism as commoning. Alex will present on how a social/cultural movement was built in Oaxaca Mexico. David will present research on a community-run waterfront in Hamburg Germany.</p>
<p>These case studies will feed into a conversation on the challenges and opportunities for community-based organizing (in Greenpoint, other neighborhoods in NYC, and further afield), focused on identifying the human factors that foster and sustain bonds within place-based social networks to engender strong community-based social spaces.</p>
<p>++++++++</p>
