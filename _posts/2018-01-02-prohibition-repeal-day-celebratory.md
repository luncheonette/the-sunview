Music from songbird [Rebecca Sullivan](https://www.rebeccasullivanjazz.com/), Andrew Schiller, & friends. Burlesque (and burlesque-adjacent) numbers from the gorgeous Veronica Viper, Bella Struts, Anita Baretta, & Oya the Animal.

(bonus: Fortuitously it's our lovely host/speakeasy-hookup St John's birthday too! Much to toast)
