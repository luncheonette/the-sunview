Jantar performs on the occasion of the first SLSC Recordings release, *Suit
Withers*, which contains six stoic attempts at experimental easy listening.
12" vinyl copies are free, just come to the luncheonette this Friday.

If you cannot make it this Friday but you would like a record, you can still
have one for FREE, just come to the luncheonette and have one beer with any
member of Jantar and then you get a copy. I am pretty much available for this
whenever, so lemme know. There will be more SLSC Recordings in the very near
future... **This Friday, on April 17, at 8:00pm, at the Sunview luncheonette,
which is at 221 Nassau Street in Brooklyn.**
