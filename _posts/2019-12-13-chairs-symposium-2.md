Comrades,

I am somewhere between ninety-five and ninety-seven percent certain that we
need to reconvene and once again attempt to ascertain what the hell is going on
with all these goddam chairs everywhere, so I have set aside the night of
December 13th, which will no doubt be a glorious fall evening, resonant with
the sounds of the house sparrows and starlings that make their homes within the
signage and aluminum siding of our dear luncheonette, for the Second Irregular
Heliacal Symposium on Chairs. Whether you are an expert on chairs or
frustratingly befuddled by them, please come prepared to present on any
chair-related topic.

Once again, this is will be a [LITERAL
SYMPOSIUM](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Symposium_scene_Nicias_Painter_MAN.jpg),
i.e. a drinking party, wherein each of us will take a turn addressing the
subject of chairs. Presentations should be somewhere between 1 second and 10
minutes. Visual aids are strenuously encouraged. All members and guests are
invited to present on topics that might include:

- [this stunning film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zThaaIfufQ) and the questions raised therein regarding chair-throwing
- So. Many. [Robotic](https://youtu.be/8CpXo_suIBY). [Chairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlXh8RvvcuI).
- Scale, Spectacle and [Chairs](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/_/fAE-6AJXfgE0Ig)
- a brief history of [stereoscopic feet propped up on chairs](http://media.getty.edu/museum/images/web/enlarge/09002201.jpg)
- the failure of consumption-oriented solutions to [chair violence](https://imgur.com/XbNfjQV)
- a phenomenological analysis of the [elaborate floating chairs](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/51/31/fe/5131fee6e897364665265d76427cc4f9.jpg) of the Baroque
