On November 29, 799, Pope Leo III returned to Rome with political protection
from Charlemagne from his enemies. On November 29, 2018, The Opiate will honor
the relevance of this date (and its own need of political protection at times
in the landscape of the insular NYC literary world) by celebrating the release
of Vol. 15 (and the tenuous return of its editor-in-chief to New York after a
self-imposed exile in Southern Italy). Readers so far will include:
