Please join me for a screening of **Elisabeth Subrin**'s *Shulie*

Shulie will be projected on 16mm (by the esteemed **Bradley Eros**). This will be proceeded by a reading by the best poet, **Mel Elberg**. (Subrin unfortunately will not be attending as she will be in Europe.) There will be dinner served. BYOB.

Description of Shulie by Video Data Bank: "A cinematic doppelganger without precedent, Elisabeth Subrin's *Shulie* uncannily and systemically bends time and cinematic code alike, projecting the viewer 30 years into the past to rediscover a woman out of time and a time out of joint—and in Subrin's words, 'to investigate the mythos and residue of the late 60s.' Staging an extended act of homage, as well as a playful, provocative confounding of filmic propriety, Subrin and her creative collaborator Kim Soss resurrect a little-known 1967 documentary portrait of a young Chicago art student, who a few years later would become a notable figure in Second Wave feminism, and author of the radical 1970 manifesto, *The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution*. Reflecting on her life and times, *Shulie* functions as a prism for refracting questions of gender, race and class that resonate in our era as in hers, while through painstaking mediation, Subrin makes manifest the eternal return of film."

Seating is quite limited at the Luncheonette, so PLEASE RSVP if you plan on coming. For those who can't make it, please save the date for the next screening on December 9th, of **A.L. Steiner**'s *More Real Than Reality Itself*

Event is free, but donations are encouraged.<br />
