Please come out the the luncheonette this Friday for ARTIST-HORROR VI: The
Driller Killer (1979). Reno Miller is an artist in New York City trying to
finish his galvanic painting of a buffalo while simultaneously grappling with
making rent, paying bills, dealing with the band rehearsals next door,
philistine art dealers, his roommates, etc., all of which just might drive him
to run amok in the city killing people with a drill. Abel Ferrara's
masterpiece, do not miss. Free pizza, free beer, hangouts at 7 film at 8.
