Come by the luncheonette this Saturday, October 12, for the fifth screening in
a series on Real Estate Horror. Next up is *Pacific Heights* from 1990,
directed by John Schlesinger. Gentrification in San Francisco, gut renovation,
home-as-profitable-investment, money pits and the tenant from hell. What was
the "yuppie horror film"? Hangouts at 7, film at 8. Free pizza, free beer.
