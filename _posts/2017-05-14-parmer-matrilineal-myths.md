<p>Keeping the matrilineal myth making going this Mothers Day, May 14 noon-3:00pm—please bring snacks and drinks, we'll have some too! On April 16 we had a conversation about matrilineal relationships—literally unfurled as female descent lines,... filtered through a feminist temporality we're thinking about how we inherit and invoke specific (and ambiguous) narratives across space and time and weave these into into the future tense of what will have been. Isn't the future imperfect a feminist tense that we're writing ourselves into? Surely some of this sounds old hat and probably somewhat essentialist too? If you think so or you don't it would be great to have your voice in the conversation about the ways that a female personas and energies persist and stand to shape shift our current ideologies and the ways we learn to know.</p>
