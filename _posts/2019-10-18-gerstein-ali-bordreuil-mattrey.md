Ali/Bordreuil/Mattrey is a freely improvised string trio that explores
unconventional sound worlds, natural resonant frequencies of the instruments,
and calls upon extended techniques through the use of preparations and
unorthodox playing styles. Active since 2014, the trio has performed at MoMA
PS1, the Rubin Museum, Issue Project Room, and Arts for Arts among others, and
recorded a radio segment on WKCR. Their debut album "i used to sing so lyrical"
was released on [Astral Spirits](https://astralspirits.bandcamp.com/) in June
2019 and celebrated with a three-hour durational performance including
collaboration with electronics, percussion, and the natural soundscape of its
outdoor location.
