<p>Dear Sunview---</p>
<p>Just got some very special news that JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon will be gracing us with His presence on <strong>Wednesday, March 5th, at 8 pm</strong>. We'll be cooking a bankers stew in His (dis)honor.  Please bring some hard alcohol. It's going to be a long, cold-hearted night.</p>
<p><strong>Jamie Dimon: Before the Nation Went Bankrupt</strong> is a lecture performance that tells the story of the financial crisis through the love letters of JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.<br />
The performance is in part a history of our current financial crisis, a conflation of romantic love and finance, and an exploration of the impulse to dominate. Not quite fiction and not quite satire, the letters are a cry in the dark from an insular world that brought us all to the brink (and beyond?) of financial, physical and moral ruin.</p>
<p>Dinner will be served, a heady and aromatic bankers stew, made from historically scarce ingredients.</p>
<p>Hope you'll be there. Please <a href="mailto:hello@thesunview.org">Let us know</a> how many kittens to drown for the banker's stew. Just kidding. It's vegan. Does that surprise you?</p>
<p>Xo<br />
DG/NS</p>
