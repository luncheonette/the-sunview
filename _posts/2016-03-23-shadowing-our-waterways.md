<p>Shadowing Our Waterways<br />
(Workshop I: Greenpoint/Newtown Creek)<br />
Collaborative art opportunity for artists and community members living, working, and/or based in Greenpoint. Application and workshop participation are free. Applicants with strong connections to the Greenpoint community who can attend all five workshop dates will be given top priority, on a first come first serve basis.</p>
<p>Shadowing Our Waterways is an intercultural project facilitated by <a href="http://butashadow.net/">But a Shadow of Myself</a>. Community members will read about the Newtown Creek and take a walking tour led by Mitch Waxman, resident historian of the Newtown Creek Alliance. Participants will collect their data and collaborate to make shadow puppets and texts based on their research.</p>
<p>Members will then videoconference and draw collaboratively with participants in Cairo, Egypt (who have already researched the Nile and made puppets, poems and an animated video).</p>
<p>Texts and images from the workshop will provide the basis for a video animated by Alexandra Zevin as well as a live shadow play developed and performed by People’s Puppets of Occupy Wall Street. https://vimeo.com/158765671</p>
<p>The five-day Greenpoint/Newtown Creek workshop will begin and end at Sunview Luncheonette. The videos, shadow play, and workshop artworks from Brooklyn and Cairo will be exhibited together, at a date and Brooklyn location TBA.</p>
<p>There will be a parallel Gowanus Canal workshop; interested Gowanus community members can look for upcoming links to that workshop.</p>
<p>Shadowing Our Waterways is made possible with public funds from the<br />
Decentralization Program of the New York State Council on the Arts, administered in Kings County by Brooklyn Arts Council.</p>
