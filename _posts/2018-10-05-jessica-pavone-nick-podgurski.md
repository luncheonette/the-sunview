[Jessica Pavone](https://www.jessicapavone.com/) (viola) + Nick Podgurski
(synthesizer)

After years of conversations about sound, drone, meditation and astrology
longtime friends Nick Podgurski and Jessica Pavone put their thoughts to sound
and create a gentle sonic landscape using synthesizer and effected viola.

[Dave Scanlon](http://www.davescanlon.com/) will present "Self-replicating No.
5". A piece written for electronics and voice demonstrating that counting
practices are musical practices.

[Yuan Liu](https://vimeo.com/minamotoyuan) will be screening short videos
