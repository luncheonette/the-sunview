<p>This Friday at the Sunview from 7pm onwards we will be celebrating Storyfile Issue #2, which had a soft-launch at the LA Art Book Fair this year.<br />
There will be a hot veg dinner, drinks, tunes, and lots of friends. (!)There will be a leave-one / take-one book-swap from which you are welcome to take a book even if you do not have one to leave behind. (!)There may be YouTube karaoke. (!)There probably won't be any readings. (!)There will definitely be birthday cake. (!!!!!)<br />
Come on out, say hi, grab a bite, and take home some new lit.<br />
And if you can't make it, we're already locking down Issue #3 for the fall...<br />
Yours,<br />
Shelby &amp; Nick<br />
