"What Truths Are Worth Telling?" is an in-progress film that investigates the
idea of "truth". The work is structured by a series of questions derived from
Bertolt Brecht's "Writing the Truth: Five Difficulties" (1935). Examples
include: “How do you recognize an idea as truthful?” and “How can different
truth claims be shared with the goal of eliciting collective action?” I posed
these questions to a range of women whose professional practices intersect with
the idea of truth, such as postcolonial theorist Gayatri Spivak, philosopher
Vanessa Wills, and writer Sarah Schulman. These conversations are paired with
footage of the hidden labor taking place within the Whitney Museum’s
conservation lab and at the London Meat Co., one of the last meatpacking
facilities that neighbors the museum.

Alex Strada is an artist and educator based in New York City. Working across
film, photography, performance, and text, her projects ask questions related to
the politics of representation, the visibility of labor, and the reproduction
of collective memory. Her process is research-based and often involves
collaboration. Strada's work has been shown at the Anthology Film Archives,
Socrates Sculpture Park, Goethe-Institut, Museum of Moving Image, Jewish
Museum, National Museum of Iceland in Reykjavik, MuseumsQuartier in Vienna,
Kaunas Biennial in Lithuania, and on the screens of Times Square with Time
Square Arts' Midnight Moment. Strada was a fellow in the Art & Law Program, the
Institute for Investigative Living at A-Z West, and the Socrates Sculpture Park
Emerging Artist Fellowship. Her work has been written about in Artsy, Vice, and
The New Yorker. Strada received a B.A. from Bates College in 2010, an M.F.A. in
Visual Art from Columbia University in 2016, and she was a 2018-2019 studio
participant in the Whitney Independent Study Program. She is adjunct faculty at
Fordham University and Columbia University.
