I WISH YOU THE BEST<br>
Sonya Derman<br>
Sunview Luncheonette<br>
July 8 and 9, 7:00PM - 11:00PM

Please stop by the Sunview Luncheonette on the weekend of July 8 & 9 for an
installation of new works by Sonya Derman. Created out of the negotiation of
constraints both formal and social, in which digital paintings and drawings
engage with the digital image-flow of the pandemic across our devices and the
servers with which they continually track and re-construct us, the works will
be projected across the luncheonette while we ourselves continue our process of
reconvening within. Toward this end the installation will also host the
following:

**Friday 7/8**<br>
Performance by Patrick Carlin Mohundro<br>
Musical performance by Zuriel Waters

**Saturday 7/9**<br>
Reading by Bethany Ides<br>
Music by Jantar

There will also be some cucumber-related food, some drinks, etc.

Sonya Derman is an interdisciplinary visual artist and educator based in New
York City. Her work is rooted in painting and writing, drawing from vernacular
and nostalgic imagery, prosaic still lives and portraiture, and self-help
mythologies. Through associative thinking and visual layering, she explores the
tension between public and private life amongst contemporary demands of
self-branding and continuous performativity.
