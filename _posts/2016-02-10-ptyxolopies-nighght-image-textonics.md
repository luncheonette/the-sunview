<p>Join us at the Sunvievv Luncheonette for a panel of thr33+ artists to discuss, present, question and preform the variegated commonities and rnultiptyxtodimensional worls of visual poetics, from Mallarmé to dump.fm. Enhanced by the possibilities of the innernots, yet against the grain of the meme, our night of vispo projected into the future and back again, captioned captioning and escaping captions closure, will answer what. Unseen practices, the avisual of the visual twice-seen (bisvisual, revisual, reversual), hypervisual, dividual, invisible and invisual.<br />
With a live stream of dump.fm throughout the evening (or until someone gets an eye poked out.)</p>
