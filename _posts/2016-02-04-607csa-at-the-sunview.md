<p>Hi Ho people of Sunview, Tianna-the-farmer reporting:<br />
So the607csa is, once again, online and ready for sign-ups!<br />
<a href="http://www.the607csa.com/shares">Check out the link here (summer, fall, and half veg shares)</a></p>
<p>and then, in my best marketing voice, I would say:  Next, explore the ‘share options’ tab for additional shares of dairy, protein (nice way of saying meat) (but including eggs), mushrooms, flowers and more.  There still may be a few more options to come, but there’s already a robust selection so please take a look.  We're quite proud of our farms and farmer-friends' farms and efforts to corral. We hope you enjoy.<br />
This year, we’re going to do a la carte week-by-week featuring a seasonal, or special items each week.</p>
<p><b>2016 SCHEDULE</b><br />
Summer CSA runs twenty weeks from <b>May 31 to Oct 11</b></p>
<p>Fall is <b>Oct 18- Nov 22.</b><br />
Half shares are full shares delivered every other week.<br />
Working with Tuesday Deliveries again for the city.</p>
<p><b>SIGN UP TIMELINE</b><br />
We’re hoping to get people to sign up by <b>May1</b> to give us time to prepare.  The earlier the better in terms of supporting us at the beginning of the season when we have little or no other source of income.</p>
<p><b>PICK-UP TIMES AND LOCATIONS </b>are <a href="http://www.the607csa.com/times-and-locations">here</a> There may be one or two additions (upstate), but these ones are set.</p>
<p>We’re looking into accepting SNAP (food stamps) for the CSA, which would be amazing, but have to figure out how it’s going to work still.</p>
<p><b>PAYMENT PLANS</b><br />
If it doesn’t work for the budget to pay all at once, members can pay in two chunks by check or paypal. Email me for details.</p>
<p>I think that covers it.<br />
THANK YOU for helping to make it possible for us to farm!!</p>
<p>your,<br />
Tianna and the <a href="http://www.the607csa.com/">607 gang</a></p>
