Come by the luncheonette this Friday, September 30, at 7 for the sixth
screening in our Real Estate Horror series. The Sentinel, from 1977, was
scheduled to screen on February 28, 2020, but was cancelled as the pandemic
began. Better late than never, here is a risible yet entertaining synthesis of
multiple prior satanic blockbusters, but set within the humiliating search for
dignified living conditions in New York City. Apartment hunting as literally
hell. The ending is an infamous and appalling exploitation of actors with
disfigurements, so I've attached <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/assets/Sutton-Avenging_the_Body.pdf">Travis Sutton's "Avenging the Body:
Disability in the Horror Film"</a> in case we'd like to discuss this aspect of
the film in relation to the genre. I have found it helpful. Hangouts at 7, film
at 8. Free pizza, free beer.
