Tuesday, October 30, 6-10pm - [Please
RSVP](https://letsreimagine.org/586/their-favorite-meals-a-potluck-for-the-dead)

Preceding the Dia de los Muertos which spans October 31 - November 2, Dinner
with the Dead invites those who have lost friends and family to cook and bring
a food item to a potluck in which the dead will be honored alongside their
favorite meals, interspersed with readings, screenings, and conversations on
the meaning of food, memory, and loss.

Throughout the world, many traditions have rituals in which a deceased friend
or family member's favorite food or beverage is enjoyed in celebration of their
life, and others where eating in the presence of the dead is thought of a way
of maintaining communication post-mortem. The event is dedicated to the memory
of Bea Koutros, who started the original Sunview with her husband Lou in 1963,
and passed away in May and to all those we have lost this year. Bring the
favorite meal of your lost loved one, friend, collaborator, and share your
memory with us.  (Note, if you won't have time to cook on a Tuesday night,
bring a poem, or a video, or a song to share.)

Organized with support from [Reimagine End of
Life](https://letsreimagine.org/), a week exploring big questions about life
and death.
