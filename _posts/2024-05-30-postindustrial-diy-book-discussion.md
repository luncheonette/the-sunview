**Hello Friends & Neighbors––**

Please join us at [Sunview Luncheonette](https://www.thesunview.org/) this
**Thursday, May 30, at 7 pm** for a book discussion with author Daniel Campo,
in conversation with Stephen Zacks, on the occasion of the release of Campo's
new book, published by [Fordham
Press](https://www.fordhampress.com/9781531504687/postindustrial-diy/). Campo's
book spotlights grassroots efforts to recover, rebuild, and enjoy
architecturally iconic but economically obsolete places in the American Rust
Belt.

[**POSTINDUSTRIAL DIY: RECOVERING AMERICAN RUST BELT
ICONS**](https://www.fordhampress.com/9781531504687/postindustrial-diy/)

"A pioneering Detroit automobile factory. A legendary iron mill at the edge of
Pittsburgh. A campus of concrete grain elevators in Buffalo. Two monumental
train stations, one in Buffalo, the other in Detroit. These once-noble sites
have since fallen from their towering grace. As local elected leaders did
everything they could to destroy what was left of these places, citizens saw
beauty and utility in these industrial ruins and felt compelled to act.
_Postindustrial DIY_ tells their stories.

The culmination of more than a dozen years of on-the-ground investigation,

ethnography, and historical analysis, author and urbanist Daniel Campo immerses
the reader in this postindustrial landscape, weaving the perspectives of dozens
of DIY protagonists as well as architects, planners, and preservationists.
Working without capital, expertise, and sometimes permission in a milieu
dominated by powerful political and economic interests, these do-it-yourself
actors are driven by passion and a sense of civic duty rather than by profit or
political expediency. They have craftily remade these sites into collective
preservation projects and democratic grounds for arts and culture,
environmental engagement, regional celebrations, itinerant play, and
in-the-moment construc­tions. Their projects are generating excitement about
the prospect of Rust Belt life, even as they often remain invisible to the
uninformed passerby and fall short of professional preservation or
environmental reclamation standards."

**Pierogi & Polish beer will be available by donation, or *BYOB*.**
