<p><i>Ready-to-hand</i> as a term is a description of the nearness or physicality of a thing in the world, specifically as related to people/persons. This term and the videos in the program are tiny slivers attempting to permeate the impermeable idea that is truth. Many of the videos question what an object has to be in order to earn its name ("steering wheel", "lever", "tear drop", "stomach"), while others study the nature of object permanence, absurdity's role in our understanding of reality, and how objects can threaten or fool.</p>

<p><strong>Irina Arnaut<br />
</strong><em>Working Title<br />
</em>r/t 15:56 min</p>
<p><i>In this absurdist take on the hero's journey, the filmmaker plays the role of a woman artist in pursuit of inspiration. At once emboldened and tormented by her own creative ambition, her artistic and cinematic predecessors, and even by her DP, she careens through a cavalcade of cultural influences before erupting in a deceptively charming slapstick routine.</i><br />
<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong><i>Scenes like one of the artist giving an earnest interview with confetti stars covering her Vaseline-smothered face, or directing an invisible Bruce Willis to deliver his famous line from “Die Hard” with more nuance, are framed by Brechtian interludes that reveal the cinematographer helping set up the slapstick shots. As the cinematographer invariably assumes an ambiguous position of authority in the narrative, the artist’s antagonistic relationship with the spectacle of vulnerability and amusement begins to unfold.</i><br />

<em>Driving Lesson</em><br />
2014<br />
r/t 11 min<br />
Sudairy gives Conant a driving lesson in Arabic. The “instructor” is from Saudi Arabia where women are not allowed to drive. The “student” is from the US where driving is very accessible, yet she got a license at the late age of 18 and hasn’t driven much since. Her license has lapsed and she now must go through the instructional process from the beginning. Echoing the absurdities surrounding their respective situations, the video features a fake car made of paper with an oil-on-canvas steering wheel, spliced with footage of a lesson shot in a real car.</p>

<p>"We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as THEY take pleasure; we read, see, and judge about literature and art as THEY see and judge; likewise we shrink back from the "great mass" as THEY shrink back; we find "shocking" what THEY find shocking." ~ M.H.</p>
<p>"The shape is the object: at any rate, what secures the wholeness of the object is the singleness of the shape." ~ M.F.</p>

<em>THE MACHINIST’S LAMENT, 2014</em><br />
HD VIDEO<br />
r/t 17 min, 47 seconds<br />
When economists and politicians talk about bringing industrial production back to America, dream logic suffuses the discussion: everything will fit again - society, economy, family - if only the factories came back.  The Machinist’s Lament speculates on this wish, while exploring one of its downsides: the alienation of the worker.  Alienation marks the wearer of safety masks separated from the world around them, while it also marks the woman who imagines the world as it could be: a wealthy industrial power ruled by women.   This is a sequel to my 2013 Safety First (Bad, Don’t Touch, Mercy!).  Footage was shot in Ohio, and voice over texts include industrial manuals, Monique Wittig’s Les Guerilleres, and Adorno’s Minima Moralia.</p>

<em>CLONAZEPAM</em> (preview)<br />
2014<br />
r/t 5 min<br />
<em>CLONAZEPAM</em> is a digitally-mediated journey across the ocean captured through a haze of panic and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Scandinavian Airlines has affixed cameras to the bellies of their airplanes. Those lo-res images stream in 4×3 aspect ratio on the tiny 6.5” seatback screens throughout their flights. In August, I took my required dose of anti-anxiety meds, and for six white-knuckle hours recorded the seatback skies as they passed below.</p>
<p><em>CLONAZEPAM</em> consists of disintegrating ‘beauty shots;’ the plane-mounted camera forming one degraded layer, the screen another, my camera a third, and the drugs a fourth. Through the tonal shifts in the white noise of the audio field of the plane’s cabin and the slight variegations in the image quality of the clouds, the video hovers between the recognizable and an abstracted trance.</p>
