<p>Friends and followers of the Sunview Luncheonette —</p>
<p>There will be a gathering on Saturday, February 7th, at around 8:33pm to wax on about the waning of Mercury in her retrograde. It’ll be a weird and bright intervention in the midst of a patterned winter darkness. We’ll prepare some food, some readings, and music but bring your brilliant brains and magnetic human bodies to 221 Nassau Avenue in Brooklyn. Also, maybe a drink and a story to share.</p>
<p>RSVP by Wednesday, February 4th!</p>

<p>Surface pressure: ~10-15 bar (0.001 picobar)<br />
Average temperature: 440 K (167 C) (590-725 K, sunward side)<br />
Total mass of atmosphere: &lt;~1000 kg</p>
<p>Atmospheric composition: 42% Oxygen (O2), 29% Sodium (Na), 22% Hydrogen (H2), 6% Helium (He), 0.5% Potassium (K), possible trace amounts of Argon (Ar), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Water (H2O), Nitrogen (N2), Xenon (Xe), Krypton (Kr), Neon (Ne), Calcium (Ca and Ca+), Magnesium (Mg)</p>
