Please by the luncheonette on Friday, December 19, at 7:00 PM for ARTIST-HORROR
XV: _Blood Bath_, from 1966. Painter Antonio Sordi is driven to murder by the
spirit of his artist ancestor. Or maybe he is a vampire who preserves his models
in wax? This movie is confusing. Animate/inanimate, violent melancholy, and a
crew of avant-garde beatniks. Free pizza, free beer. Hangouts at 7, film at 8.
