<p>hi M.</p>
<p>I'm actually in Sao Paulo now getting ready for the events of <a href="http://Lanchonete.org" target="_blank">Lanchonete.org</a> in the Architecture Biennial, which start tomorrow -- <a href="http://artfuladministrator.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/pdf_lanchonete_preview_20131108_a.pdf" target="_blank">here is something about it.</a></p>
<p>But before I dive into that, I wanted to ask you if you'd like to be involved in an event on Sunday, November 24th at the Sunview (http://thesunview.org) in G_____ at which we'll make food and have fun, and I'll present on Lanchonete.org.</p>
<p>I'm cc'ing D. here who has offered to make some Brazilian fare .. and T. who has offered to help .. and you came to mind too. I'd love to have you involved.</p>
<p>Looking forward to this.</p>
<p>All best,<br />
T.</p>
