This meeting will take place on Monday April 29 at 7pm.

The Sunview Luncheonette<br>
221 Nassau Street, Brooklyn NY 11222

Jenny Perlin will present "The Long Sleepers", a project she has been working
on since 2014. Through experimental animations, live-action film, drawings, and
performances, Perlin has explored the devastating environmental phenomena that
are sinkholes, the formation and development of caverns and cave tourism, and
mining mysteries in a novel by Jules Verne.

Jenny Perlin makes films, videos, installations, and drawings. Her projects
draw on interdisciplinary research interests in history, cultural studies,
literature and linguistics. Her films incorporate innovative techniques to
investigate history as it relates to the present. Perlin shoots 16mm film and
digital video and combines live-action, staged, and documentary images with
hand-drawn, text-based animation.
