Come by the luncheonette this Friday, November 5, for the third screening in a
series on Real Estate Horror. Next up is *Wolfen* from 1981, directed by Micahel
Wadleigh. We'll look at the themes of violence and terrorism as they take place
in relation to real estate development in the South Bronx, set in the context
of the 1970s economic crisis in NYC. We'll address the problematic horror trope
of the "haunted Indian burial ground" (as in *Poltergeist*, for example), and the
ways that *Wolfen* reproduces many of these elements while simultaneously
subverting them. Hangouts at 7, film at 8.
