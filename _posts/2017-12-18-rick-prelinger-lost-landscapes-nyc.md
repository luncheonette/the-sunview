I am writing to invite you to an evening and screening with Rick Prelinger at the Sunview Luncheonette in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Audrey Snyder has organized the gathering alongside Dylan Gauthier and Joe Riley to welcome Rick and Megan Prelinger to New York and share a screening, refreshments, and stories. We would all love to see you next Friday, November 10 at 7:30p at 221 Nassau Ave, Brooklyn.

Rick Prelinger joins Sunview Luncheonette for a sunset conversation on the making of his Lost Landscapes series and the importance of mobilizing the past to intervene in the present and future. Rick will present historic clips, amateur camera-pointing, and moving-image outtakes covering daily life, work, and celebration of NYC. Refreshments of a vanishing New York will be served and letterpress printed posters will be available for $25. All proceeds will go to Sunview's ongoing fundraising effort in support of the recovery effort in Puerto Rico.

Rick Prelinger is an archivist, writer, filmmaker and educator. His collection of 60,000 ephemeral films was acquired by Library of Congress in 2002. Beginning in 2000, he partnered with Internet Archive to make a subset of the Prelinger Collection (now 7,000 films) available online for free viewing, downloading and reuse. His archival feature Panorama Ephemera (2004) played in venues around the world, and his feature project No More Road Trips? received a Creative Capital grant in 2012. His 21 Lost Landscapes participatory urban history projects have played to many thousands of viewers in San Francisco, Detroit, Oakland, Los Angeles and elsewhere. He is a board member of Internet Archive and frequently writes and speaks on the future of archives and issues relating to archival access and regeneration. With Megan Shaw Prelinger, he co-founded Prelinger Library in 2004. He is currently Professor of Film & Digital Media at University of California, Santa Cruz.
