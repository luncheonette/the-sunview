Hi all, happy autumn! Let us get back to the business of hanging, drinking,
eating and sounds. This Friday at 8:00, [August Wells](http://www.augustwells.com/)
will perform at the Sunview. I will make the official meal of Rumori: pasta
putanesca. Bring some other things to eat, and some booze, we'll fire up the
Russian fairy tales like old times, and we can all complain about how terrible
summer was and plan for how awesome autumn is going to be. 20 square lathe
copies of 1920s AM radio August Wells' "Here in the Wild" b/w "Come on in out
of that Night" available. As usual, all is free, and all donations go to Bea.
See you there!
