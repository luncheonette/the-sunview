[once, a student asked the granddaughter of the great virginia ballad singer,
texas gladden — "who is allowed to sing your granny's songs?" vicki replied
without mentioning singing, saying, "if you were hungry, she would give you the
money to go buy a chicken. you’d bring the chicken to her and she’d cook you up
the chicken."]


*there will be a vegan soup option as well
