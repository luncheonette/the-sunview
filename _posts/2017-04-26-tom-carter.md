Next Wednesday, April 26, there will a nice show at the luncheonette - Tom
Carter, Tropical Rock (Ka Baird and Camilla Padgett-Coles), and Jantar. It
will be an early show (school night!), so I imagine Jantar will begin well
before 8:00 - probably in background-mood-music-for-cooking mode. But do come
early for dinner, Forrest will make soup, etc., for everyone, and there will
be free booze - all the usual enticements. We can break out that good 99
cent-store rotating colored light, Iâ€™m sure. Pasolini's _Canterbury Tales_ on
VHS in the back. Yes. I hope you can make it!

Hope everyone is swell!
