This post-TG Saturday come get some real love, after being thoroughly bummed out and confused by your Trump-loving fam! St. John, Tim, and Jess (Sintimjess) are gonna have another dope show at The Sunview Luncheonette in Greenpoint, but this time we're stepping up the game -- no showing old work. Fuck that. For you to really heal you need the most piping-hot, oven-stinking, face-hugging ... NEW WORKS! 



This is work that hasn’t been seen by anyone else but the crews, and those people live in underground bunkers with their eyes and tongues gouged out! 



 TIM - Gonna talk about making his feature doc on Chelsea Manning and show the trailer (no one's seen the trailer except the people who made it, and they've mysteriously ‘disappeared' — even Tim himself aint seen it!).



JESS -- Gonna show her still-in-post doc about Chinese tourists taking over the tiny island of Palau (which is a follow up to her last doc about Chinese malls taking over the world, which won all awards and shit).



ST. JOHN -- Gonna have (and film) a live auction of family heirlooms to raise money for his New York dating life (getting laid aint cheap, yo, so bring $$$).



After the show we’ll go to a local bar and heal some more. Be there or be crazy!
