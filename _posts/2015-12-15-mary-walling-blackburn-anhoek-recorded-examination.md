<p><em>WIth Mary Walling Blackburn and Rafael Kelman.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mwb-and.me/">Anhoek School</a>, a roving and irregular pedagogical experiment, will administer the ARE, its own perverse form of the Graduate Recorded Examination (GRE). The test will be timed, monitored, and scored. The ARE subject area administered, at an undisclosed testing site, is The Reproductive, an investigation of the fetus-animal, the worker-maker, and their life and death system in the form of an unruly exam.</p>
<p>A full spectrum doula, Lucy Yanow, will begin with a remotely administered quiz; asking participants to kindly hold together and apart the individual and “the contents of their uterus” as the doula elects to do.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the test will be administered to participants, each situated parenthetically between their own birth and death, interwoven with the birth and death of others, the non-birth and non-death of others.</p>
