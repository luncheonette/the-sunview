Pillowcase + Bullhorn</p>
<p>H. Honne Wells I heard on two 'FMU shows within a week of each other, and it got me scrambling through a few Internet rabbit holes.</p>
<p>After emerging from one, I realized it was somebody I had a few mutual friends with. The bits I heard were from a recording called "Goodbye Niagara Suite."</p>
<p>But here are three tracks from a different album (about halfway through the playlist):</p>

<p>I'm going to let Sarah do the talking herself:Â http://sarahhalpern.com/music</p>
<p>She's multi-talented and I've only had one cup of coffee, not enough to do her justice.</p>
<p>And Pillowcase + Bullhorn, well - it's going to be a guy telling a story through a bullhorn with a pillowcase over his head.</p>
<p>It should be a good night.</p>
