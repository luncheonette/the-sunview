Auto Body Emotives</b><b> </b>started as a series of improvisational exercises between a printing press and Annette Knol. Is it even possible to collaborate with a machine or an object? This book wants to extend this notion. To open up the question friends and colleagues were invited to respond. This publication is the result. A collection of writings, drawings, and collages by 19 artists and writers from NYC, Berlin, UK, and Santiago de Chile.<br />
