Please join us for a screening of [Vagabond's
Caravan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313745/). This gorgeous music doc,
follows the Krautrock band Embryo as they caravan through Iran, Afghanistan and
India in 1979, playing with local musicians along the way. It is an incredible
document, exquisitely shot on film.

We'll make some kind of light veggie meal. Feel free to bring a snack or bottle
to share! Here's a [sneak peek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN6xMtDvJCQ),
sans subtitles. Our screening will include subs.  Hope to see you then!
