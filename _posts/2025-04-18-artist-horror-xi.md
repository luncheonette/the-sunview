Friday, April 18 - ARTIST-HORROR XI: Two Evil Eyes: The Black Cat (1990). Rod
Usher resorts to murder in the course of his pursuit of Weegee-esque
authenticity. You might think Harvey Keitel in a Poe adaption by Dario Argento
would be great, but you would be wrong. This movie is terrible. Come see it.
Free pizza, free beer. Hangouts at 7, film at 8. Last oneâ€¦
