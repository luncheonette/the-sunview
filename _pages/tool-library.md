The **Sunview** presents an alternative model of community space in the face of
the relentless instrumentalization of the built environment. Instead of a space
characterized by commercial exchange through which profit might be extracted
from real estate, the Sunview is premised on the notion that every urban block
could (or should) have its nexus of free exchange - a garden, watering hole,
library, WiFi access point, file sharing (sub-)network, swap meet, mess hall,
free press, and radio station. The **HTLE** works toward realizing this premise
by establishing a limited-range model for sharing, while fostering a
communitarian spirit over and against the isolating effects of urban
architecture and rampant development.

The **Henry St. Tool Library and Exchange**, apart from being a site which
provides access to a great variety of tools which might be of use, operates
under two interlocking principle concerns:

- What do we consider a tool, and how might we reconsider ideas around access
  and application of the tools around us, be they smart phones, hammers, or
  our collective energy?
- What is the relation between the value of a tool and the systems through
  which they are distributed?

We aim to bring in volunteer librarians throughout the year who will help
establish the library over periods of one or more days per week, allowing for
a schedule of open hours. Librarians help run the library, including the
day-to-day cataloguing of skills-to-share, wares, books and goods, but also
help to curate, contextualize and inform the collection. IRL librarians also
welcome. Application forms will be posted online and outside the window of the
Luncheonette starting on July 10th, and may be dropped off in person or via
USPS mail on an open basis. Electronic submissions will not be accepted.
