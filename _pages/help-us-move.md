title: Help Us Move to a New Space
---

After 12 ✨stellar✨ years as a cooperative, not-for-profit and post-capitalist
community art and cultural space in Greenpoint, the Sunview Luncheonette is
preparing for a cosmic transition.

The building at 221 Nassau Ave has been sold, and while this marks the end of an
era, it is also the beginning of a new one for the collective.

We are moving to **a new home**—one that will continue to be an **inclusive
gathering space** for artists, organizers, eco-activists, poets and writers,
neighbors, and friends, and we need your help to make it happen!

We’re aiming to raise **$30,000** to cover:

📦 **Storage for Sunview fixtures and artworks while we move** ($3,000 for six months)<br>
🚛 **Moving costs** ($2,000)<br>
🔨 **Building out our new space** ($17,000)<br>
🏠 **Security and insurance for a new location** ($8,000)<br>
(Plus unknown costs that may arise in the move.)

The Sunview has always been **more than a space**—it’s a shared commitment to
community, art, commoning, and collective care. As we **SUNSET** 221 Nassau and
prepare to **SUNRISE in a new space**, your support will ensure that the Sunview
continues to be a place for **radical hospitality, creativity, music, art,
poetics, and conversation.** 

As we prepare to move into a new space, we are grateful to the Koutros family
for their support of our project over the years. We also want to express our
love, respect, and admiration for our late co-founder Demetra “Bea” Koutros, who
invited us to reimagine the diner she had run for 45 years with her husband Lou
as an under-the-radar, informal third space with her in 2011 and charmed us
every day until her passing in 2018.
