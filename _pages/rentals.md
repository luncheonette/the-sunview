The Sunview is available for occasional rental and use by neighbors, film/photo crews, and the general public.  We are also open to hosting meetings and retreats for small/local nonprofits, local organizing efforts, and social-justice-focused community groups, so feel free to reach out.

It is a 1960's diner / luncheonette in mostly original decor.

Send us a note to locations@thesunview.org or call (612) 787-7434.
