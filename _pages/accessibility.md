title: Accessibility at the Sunview Luncheonette
---

The Sunview Luncheonette is committed to creating a welcoming, inclusive, and
accessible space for all visitors, participants, and collaborators. Our programs
are rooted in hospitality, mutual care, and the spirit of experimentation, and
we strive to ensure that everyone can take part in the life of the Luncheonette.

## Physical Accessibility
The Luncheonette’s current location is on the ground floor and can be accessed
directly from the sidewalk. Restrooms are located on the same level as the main
space but are not yet fully ADA-compliant. We are working toward improving
accessibility as part of our ongoing renovations.

## Events and Gatherings
We aim to make our public programs—including meals, talks, screenings, and
performances—accessible and comfortable for a range of participants.

If you have specific access needs or questions prior to visiting or attending an
event, please reach out to us at hello@thesunview.org. We welcome conversations
about how to make our space and programs more accessible and are always learning
how to do better.
