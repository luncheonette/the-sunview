  <h3>We're Moving!</h3>
  <p>
    After 12 ✨stellar✨ years as a cooperative, not-for-profit community art and
    cultural space in Greenpoint, the Sunview Luncheonette is preparing for a
    cosmic transition. The building at <strong>221 Nassau Ave</strong> has been
    sold, and while this marks the end of an era, it is also the beginning of a
    new one for the collective.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are moving to <strong>a new home</strong>—one that will continue to be an
    <strong>inclusive gathering space</strong> for artists, organizers,
    eco-activists, poets and writers, neighbors, and friends, and we need your
    help to make it happen!
