    <span class="h2">The Sunview Luncheonette</span> is a storefront on pause,
    a member-based social club, a sometimes microvenue for art, poetics, regionalism,
    mutual aid, and commoning. It is resistant to traditional forms of commerce,
    commodification, and to gentrification. It is above all, an &ldquo;approach,&rdquo; and
    least of all, an &ldquo;outcome.&rdquo; It is unknown. It is hopeful. It saves you a
    seat at the counter.
